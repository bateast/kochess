1.c4 g6 2.Nc3 c5 3.e3 {a rare continuation, with g3 being the overwhelming
favorite and Nf3 the next most popular option.} 3...Bg7 4.d4 {the logical
immediate follow-up to the previous move, although waiting with Nf3 looks fine
as well.} 4...d6 5.h3 {one effect of Black's last move was to release the
light-square bishop, so White decides to take away the g4 square prior to
further development.} 5...Nc6 6.Nf3 e6 {freeing e7 for the knight development
and contesting the d5 square.} 7.Be2 ( 7.dxc5 {would force a queenless
middlegame after} 7...dxc5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8 {but this is evidently not to White's
liking and looks very drawish.} ) 7...Nge7 {here the knight stays out of the way
of the Bg7, allowing it to pressure d4.} 8.O-O cxd4 9.exd4 Nf5 10.Bg5 Qb6 
{Black continues to pile up on d4, so White releases the tension.} 11.d5 Ncd4 
12.Nxd4 Nxd4 13.dxe6 {this sets up a long, partly forced sequence.} ( 13.Be3 
{is a possible alternative, after which the game could go a significantly
different route.} ) 13...Bxe6 14.Be3 Nxe2+ ( {Alternatives such as} 14...O-O 
{do not work out well for Black, for example} 15.Kh1 {removing the king from the
unpinning tactic} 15...Rac8 16.Nb5 Bxc4 17.Nxd4 Bxd4 18.Bxd4 Bxe2 19.Qd2 Qb5 
20.Rfe1 Rfe8 21.Qh6 f6 22.Bxf6 $16 ) 15.Qxe2 Qc6 16.Nd5 {a common theme in the
English is to occupy d5 with a knight, even if it cannot be maintained there,
since often the results still favor White.} 16...Bxd5 17.cxd5 Qxd5 {the win of
the pawn is only temporary for Black.} ( 17...Qa6 18.Qxa6 bxa6 $14 {would leave
Black with an annoying structural flaw on the queenside, but with a much safer
king position.} ) 18.Bf4+ $16 Kf8 {now Black's king is stuck in the center, also
shutting out the Rh8 from play.} ( 18...Be5 {is no help, for example} 19.Rad1 
Qe6 20.Qb5+ Kf8 21.Bh6+ Bg7 22.Rfe1 Qf5 23.Qxb7 $18 ) 19.Rfd1 {White continues
with the initiative.} 19...Qf5 20.Bxd6+ {now White has regained the pawn and has
positional dominance.} 20...Kg8 21.Rac1 {mobilizing White's "extra" rook.} 
21...h5 {attempting to move the king off the back rank and free the rook stuck
in the corner.} 22.Rc7 b5 {attempting to save the pawn.} ( 22...Kh7 $5 ) 23.Rd3 
{a strong rook lift idea, threatening to go to the f-file.} 23...Rc8 $2 {the
losing move, although Black was in difficulties regardless. With this move,
Black sets herself up for a deflection tactic on the Qf5, which is the only
protector of the Rc8. Perhaps Black instinctively thought the rook was protected
by its back-rank partner, as would normally be the case if the king weren't
blocking it.} 24.g4 $1 hxg4 25.hxg4 {and the Rc8 is lost, so Black resigns.} 1-0
