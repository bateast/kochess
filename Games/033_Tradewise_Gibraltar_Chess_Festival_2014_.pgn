1.e4 c6 2.d3 {indicating that White will go into the King's Indian Attack.} 
2...d5 3.Nd2 e5 4.Ngf3 Bd6 5.g3 Nf6 6.Bg2 O-O 7.O-O Re8 8.Re1 Nbd7 9.a3 {more
common here is either c3, reinforcing the center, or b3, preparing to develop
the bishop.} 9...a5 {a typical reaction, restraining the b4 advance.} 10.b3 d4 
{while there are a variety of moves that are playable here, the text move scores
100 percent for Black!} 11.Nh4 ( 11.Bb2 {seems better, in order to make some
progress on development and free up the first rank for White's heavy pieces.} ) 
11...Bf8 {Black anticipates Nf5, hitting the bishop, and proactively reinforces
his kingside, as e5 no longer needs the bishop's attention.} 12.Nf1 {this is
consistent with White leaving the bishop on c1, but appears to be too slow.
Black will get his play on the queenside and in the center before White can
develop any threats on the kingside.} 12...a4 13.b4 c5 {the pawn is used as a
lever to open the c-file for Black.} 14.bxc5 Ra5 $5 {an original way of getting
the rook into play.} ( 14...Qc7 {is more normal-looking and less committal.} ) 
15.Nf5 {White is playing too slowly and not bringing enough of his army to
bear.} ( 15.f4 $5 $15 ) 15...Rxc5 16.g4 Re6 $17 {Houdini agrees that this other
unusual rook lift is the best for Black. Along the third rank, the rook can
immediately increase pressure on the c-file and also be available for defense on
the kingside, if needed. Black also clears a retreat square for the knight,
based on the threat created by White's last move.} 17.h3 {White apparently still
feels no sense of urgency.} ( 17.g5 {would at least be consistent.} ) 17...Rec6 
18.c4 {White chooses the least worst option, jettisoning the doomed c-pawn and
picking up the a-pawn in return. However, Black is still in a dominant position
and White has no counterplay.} 18...dxc3 19.Qxa4 c2 $19 {a powerful move,
cutting the Qa4 off from the kingside and ensuring White will have to cover the
c1 square at all costs.} 20.Be3 Rc3 {Black keeps pounding away with his amazing
rooks.} 21.d4 Qc7 {forming "Alekhine's Gun", with the R+R+Q on the same file.} 
( 21...R6c4 22.Qb5 exd4 23.Nxd4 Nc5 {is Houdini's preferred way to make
progress.} ) 22.g5 $6 {this makes it easier for Black.} ( 22.Rec1 {blocking the
pawn advance would make for stronger resistance, on the next move as well.} ) 
22...Ne8 23.d5 {this simply forces the rook to a better square.} 23...R6c4 
24.Qb5 c1=Q {White will lose a piece with no compensation and a fractured
position, so resigns. An impressive c-file for Black!} 0-1
