1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 {we now have a Gruenfeld-English setup on the board} 
4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Qb3 {White has a number of different options here. The text move
scores well at 62 percent in the database.} 5...Nb6 {the overwhelming choice is
to retreat, rather than exchange off the knight. Interestingly, Nakamura has
also played this line as Black (see move 7 game variation).} 6.d4 Bg7 7.e4 
{developing the dark-square bishop here is more popular, as in this earlier
top-level game featuring Nakamura as Black:} ( 7.Bf4 Be6 8.Qa3 Nc6 9.e3 O-O

(2800)-Nakamura,H (2758) Moscow 2011} ) 7...Bg4 {Black indirectly pressures the
White center with this move. Strategically, we have a situation with a classic
pawn center versus an Indian-style development by Black designed to put pressure
on it.} 8.Bb5+ {White knows well that Black will block with the c-pawn. The
point of the move is to cause Black to take away the c6 square from his own
knight, forcing it to a lesser square that does not influence d4.} 8...c6 9.Ng5 
{we are still in theory here, but this is nonetheless an instructive in-between
move. Rather than simply retreat the bishop, White looks to improve his position
first. But what about the d-pawn?} 9...e6 $146 {all previous games had featured
castling, as in the following high-level contest:} ( 9...O-O 10.Be2 Bxe2

Bucharest 2012} ) 10.Be2 Bxe2 11.Nxe2 Bxd4 {in the analagous position in the
variation where Black castles first, only one person in the database dared take
the central pawn, and lost.} 12.Nxd4 Qxd4 {What is going on here, then? Black is
currently a pawn up and White apparently has no immediate threats that could
recoup the material. For Class players, most of us would therefore hate to be
White. One clue, however, is that Houdini rates this position as a half-pawn
advantage to White. Let's see how this is translated on the board.} 13.Bd2 
{threatening the skewer on c3} 13...Qc5 ( 13...O-O 14.Qh3 $16 ) 14.Rc1 Qe7 
15.a4 {the idea is to kick the Nb6 and expose the half-open b-file.} 15...N8d7 
$6 {this allows White to implement his plan without a fight.} ( 15...h6 $5 
16.Nf3 Na6 17.a5 Nc8 $14 {would leave Black's pieces awkwardly placed and not
set up well for castling, but at least he would retain the pawn for some
compensation.} ) 16.a5 Nc8 17.Qxb7 Rb8 18.Qxc6 {now White is a pawn up and still
has a much better position. The b2 pawn is tactically protected from the Rb8,
given the lack of other defenders of the Nc8.} 18...O-O 19.Nf3 Rd8 ( 19...Rxb2 
{is still not possible:} 20.Qc3 Rb8 21.Bh6 {and Black either loses material or
gets mated on g7.} ) ( 19...Nd6 $16 {is Houdini's suggestion, at least getting
the knight back in the fight.} ) 20.O-O e5 ( 20...Rxb2 $2 {although the Black
rook is no longer on f8 to be threatened, taking the b2 pawn is *still* not
possible, due to yet another tactical comeback involving Bh6:} 21.Qxc8 Rxc8 
22.Rxc8+ Nf8 23.Bh6 $18 ) 21.Rfd1 $18 {White brings his remaining piece into the
game and Black is amazingly helpless in this position. As noted in the previous
variation, he actually has a back rank problem, despite both his rooks being
there, due to the holes around his king and the unopposed White dark square
bishop.} 21...f6 22.Bh6 Kf7 {getting off the back rank, but White has other
threats as well. Note how Black's pieces, especially the knights and rooks, are
uncoordinated and get in each others' way.} 23.Qc4+ {Nakamura no doubt
calculated the next sequence through to the endgame.} ( 23.Qc7 {played
immediately, according to Houdini, would give White a greater advantage in the
middlegame, for example} 23...Ke8 24.Qc4 Nf8 25.Rxd8+ Qxd8 26.Qg8 Qd6 27.Nd2 
{with Nc4 coming} ) 23...Qe6 24.Qc7 {White exploits Black's weak rooks and
overloaded Nd7.} 24...Ke8 25.Rxd7 Qxd7 26.Qxb8 Nb6 {a clever way to get the
knight into the game, but White returns the favor with his own counterattack.} 
27.Nxe5 Rxb8 28.Nxd7 Nxd7 {White has engineered a transition to what should be a
winning endgame.} 29.h4 {preventing Black from attempting to shut the bishop in
with ...g5} 29...Rb5 ( 29...Rxb2 {still does not work for Black:} 30.Rc8+ Ke7 
31.Ra8 ) 30.Rc8+ Ke7 31.Rh8 Rxb2 32.Rxh7+ {White decides to munch on Black's
kingside pawns rather than on the queenside one.} 32...Ke6 33.Be3 a6 34.Rg7 Ne5 
35.Bc5 f5 36.Bd4 Rb1+ 37.Kh2 Rb5 38.Bxe5 Kxe5 39.Rxg6 {Black now acknowledges
that he is lost.} 1-0
