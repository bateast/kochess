1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6 {the Bronstein-Larsen makes
its third appearance in the championships.} 6.g3 {Hess avoids the main line with
c3, as the other White players have done in this tournament. Here he chooses to
immediately fianchettoes his bishop. While this is a main idea in the c3 line,
the early fianchetto is rarely played.} 6...Nd7 {has not been played before in
the database. This seems like a slow way to develop.} ( 6...h5 {actually scores
over 60 percent for Black. Kingside aggression is the key to success in this
variation.} ) 7.Bg2 Nb6 {an early commitment of the knight to this square, but
Black now needs to get it out of the way of his bishop and queen.} 8.b3 {White
focuses on pawn moves rather than piece development.} ( 8.Nf3 $5 ) 8...Bf5 ( 
8...h5 {is what Houdini likes here, but Black evidently doesn't feel aggressive
enough.} ) 9.c4 Qd7 10.a4 Rd8 {with White's queenside pawns already looking
menacing, Black decides not to castle long.} 11.a5 Nc8 12.a6 $14 b6 {Despite
White's lack of piece development to this point, his bishops have great
prospects and has a potentially better king position, while Black's king is not
so comfortable.} 13.Ne2 Bh3 14.Bxh3 Qxh3 15.Nf4 Qd7 16.O-O $16 {Black's sole
attacking idea on the kingside, exchanging on Bg2, has been neutralized by
White, who now also has a significantly safer king.} 16...Bg7 ( 16...Qxd4 $6 
17.Qf3 {threatens c6 and gives White major attacking prospects.} 17...Bg7 ( 
17...Qxa1 $2 18.Qxc6+ Rd7 19.Qxc8+ Rd8 20.Qc6+ Rd7 21.Rd1 ) 18.Ba3 ) 17.Qf3 O-O 
{while not a poor move in this situation, it's a bad strategic sign for Black,
who was not able to use the g-file for anything and now is saddled with
permanent positional flaws.} 18.d5 cxd5 19.Nxd5 f5 20.Ra2 {White keeps his
options open for the rook.} 20...e6 21.Nb4 Qd4 {it appears like Black is lashing
out desperately, hoping for counterplay.} ( 21...Qe8 {is Houdini's suggestion,
which is more passive and defensive in nature.} ) 22.Qb7 Qc3 23.Nc6 {White's
pieces are simply dominant at this point.} 23...Rd3 24.Ra3 {White now safely
neutralizes Black's attack.} 24...Bd4 25.b4 Qxc4 26.Rxd3 Qxd3 27.Nxd4 Qxd4 
28.Bh6 {although now a pawn down, this is meaningless, as White's pieces still
thoroughly dominate the board.} 28...Rd8 29.Rc1 Nd6 30.Qxa7 Ne4 31.Be3 Qxb4 
32.Qxb6 Qxb6 33.Bxb6 {the win now takes shape.} 33...Ra8 34.a7 Nf6 ( 34...Nd6 
{would be more stubborn, according to Houdini.} ) 35.Bd4 Nd5 36.Rb1 {and Black
cannot stop Rb8} 1-0
