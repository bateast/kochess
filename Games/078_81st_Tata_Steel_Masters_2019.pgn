1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.Bd3 {the Exchange Variation has been making a
comeback at high levels.} 4...Nf6 ( 4...Nc6 {is the main line, forcing White to
play c3 in response.} ) 5.c3 {White plays it anyway, which eventually leads to a
transposition back to the main line, at least for Black.} 5...Qc7 {placing the
queen on c7 this early used to be a quirky sideline. It's now more mainstream,
I'm sure in large part due to its practical success. The main idea is
straightforward, to take over the b8-h2 diagonal and prevent White from playing
Bf4. As the queen wants to go here in most lines anyway, playing it early and
preventing White's bishop from seizing the diagonal makes a lot of sense.} 6.h3 
{this is seldom played. The evident idea is to take away the use of the g4
square from Black, for either the knight or bishop.} 6...g6 {a new move in this
position according to the database, but not a new idea in the Exchange
Variation. Black looks like he is fianchettoing his bishop, but in fact the main
idea is to play play ...Bf5 and then open the g-file.} 7.Nf3 Bf5 8.Ne5 {White
holds off on the bishop exchange and places his knight on the e5 outpost, ready
to take back on d3. This also potentially opens up f3 for his queen.} 8...Nc6 
{although this position isn't in the database, for Black it's a standard setup
in the Exchange Variation. In this game, White is further behind in development
than normal, with only two pieces out to Black's four.} 9.Bf4 {now White has
essentially caught up, as Black will have to move the queen again either
immediately or after an exchange on e5.} 9...Qb6 ( 9...Nxe5 {it might seem under
general principles that exchanging off White's central knight is a good
proposition. However, leaving the a4-e8 diagonal open results in a small plus
for White. For example, this continuation leaves Black's king in the center:} 
10.Bxf5 Nd3+ 11.Bxd3 Qxf4 12.Bb5+ Nd7 13.Bxd7+ Kxd7 14.O-O $14 ) ( 9...Bxd3 
{engines like this move, but it betrays the original idea of the variation.} 
10.Nxd3 Qb6 11.O-O {and White has an easy game, while Black is solid but without
real prospects.} ) 10.Bxf5 gxf5 {this is what Anand was going for with the
variation.} 11.Nd3 {this avoids a possible exchange on e5 and protects b2, but
is still a backwards move of the same piece in the opening. Moreover, exchanging
on e5 or taking on b2 for Black does not look dangerous.} ( 11.Nd2 Nxe5 ( 
11...Qxb2 $6 {going pawn hunting will leave Black dangerously behind in
development.} 12.Rb1 Qxa2 13.O-O Qa6 14.Ra1 Qb5 15.Qf3 $16 {with Rfb1 a threat.} 
) 12.dxe5 Nd7 13.O-O Rg8 14.Nb3 $14 ) 11...e6 {the standard consolidating move
for Black in this structure.} 12.Nd2 {getting the final minor piece out.} 
12...Rg8 {by this point Black has achieved a dynamic equality. He has some
longer-term structural weaknesses (including the h7 pawn and dark-square holes)
but in return he has dynamic piece play and the half-open g-file.} 13.O-O O-O-O 
{the only real place to put the Black king, also developing the queenside rook.} 
14.a4 {now that Black has committed with his king, White grabs some space on the
queenside. This is not dangerous for Black, though, as a4-a5 is not yet
possible.} 14...Ne4 {improving this piece considerably, as the most it was doing
on f6 was guarding h5. With Black's king tucked away on the queenside, though,
that is not critical.} 15.Rc1 ( 15.Qh5 Rg7 $11 ) ( 15.f3 Ng3 16.Rf2 Be7 $11 ) 
15...Bd6 {a case where exchanging minor pieces is clearly indicated for Black.
White's dark-square bishop would otherwise help dominate the dark squares, while
the Black counterpart has nowhere else as useful to go.} 16.Bxd6 Nxd6 17.b4 
{this type of position is important for Caro-Kann players to understand. White's
pawn thrusts on the queenside look scary, but Anand deals with them
effectively.} 17...Kb8 {taking the king off the c-file and removing it from
potential tactics involving the rook opposite it. Also vacates the c8 square for
another piece. This is a good example of a move that "doesn't do anything"
immediate but is valuable in the long run, with White not having a concrete
threat in the meantime.} 18.Qe2 ( 18.a5 Qc7 19.Nc5 Ne4 $11 ) 18...Qc7 
{proactively retreating the queen. It was doing no good on b6 anyway, now it can
move along the 7th rank and also is well-positioned on the b8-h2 diagonal.} 
19.Qe3 {White with this move basically admits he has nothing on the queenside
and tries to generate some action in the center.} 19...Ne7 {improving his
weakest piece. On c6 the knight was shut down by White's pawns.} 20.f3 $6 
{perhaps attempting to be prophylactic and shut Black's knight out of e4.
However, now White has a more serious dark-square weakness, absent his bishop,
and it affects the space in front of his king, with g3 and e3 now becoming more
vulnerable.} ( 20.Kh1 {would step away from the g-file and keep the balance.} ) 
20...Ng6 {Black's knight immediately gets into play. The threat is now f5-f4, as
we shall see.} 21.Ne5 $2 {White must have miscalculated the impact of Black's
next move.} ( 21.Kh1 {as in the previous note is more prudent, but Black still
gets an edge.} 21...f4 {the pawn is tactically protected, due to a "removal of
the guard" being available if White takes with the knight.} 22.Qe1 ( 22.Nxf4 $2 
Nf5 $1 {chasing away the queen and the Nf4's only protection.} ) 22...Nf5 
23.Rf2 {and White's pieces are awkwardly tied up.} ) 21...f4 22.Qe1 Nf5 23.Nxg6 
{this just clears the way for Black on the g-file, but White appears to be
losing in all variations.} ( 23.Rf2 {would be analagous to the above variation,
but now White has a lot more problems. The Ne5 is vulnerable to ...f6, among
other things.} 23...Ngh4 $1 {and White has no good response to Black's threats,
including piling up on the g-file and playing ...Ne3.} 24.Nf1 ( 24.c4 {doesn't
gain White anything after} 24...Rc8 $19 ) ( 24.Ng4 h5 25.Nf6 Rg6 26.Qe5 Ne3 
{and White loses material.} ) 24...f6 25.Ng4 h5 26.Ngh2 Rg6 $19 {it's looking
grim for White on the g-file and Black also has the ...e5 pawn lever coming.} ) 
23...Rxg6 24.Rf2 Rdg8 {simple and effective.} 25.c4 ( 25.Qe5 {exchanging queens
won't help White.} 25...Qxe5 26.dxe5 Nh4 $19 {and the g-pawn falls.} ) 25...Ne3 
{Black correctly ignores the attempt at counterplay on the c-file.} 26.cxd5 
Nxg2 {no need to wait for the capture, as White's queen is now also en prise.} 
27.Qe5 Qxe5 28.dxe5 Ne1+ {with the fork ...Nd3 to follow. A strong finish to the
game by Anand.} 0-1
