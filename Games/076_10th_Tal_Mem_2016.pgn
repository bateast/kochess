1.c4 e5 2.g3 {this very early fianchetto is a popular way to play the English} 
2...Nf6 3.Bg2 d5 {the most challenging, immediately looking to establish a
central presence.} 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 {now it looks like a reversed Sicilian,
doesn't it? In fact that is how ECO classifies it.} 6.O-O Nb6 7.d3 {with Black
controlling d4, White must opt for a more restrained game, looking to control
the center with pieces, which is the point of the original setup.} 7...Be7 
8.Be3 O-O 9.Nbd2 {this move eyes both e4 and c4, but neglects d5. It does leave
the c-file half-open for White's rook, though.} ( 9.Nc3 {would be a fine (and
more natural) alternative development for the knight, focusing more on the key
d5 square.} ) 9...Be6 ( 9...Nd5 $5 {would be the way to immediately take
advantage of the knight development; the engine considers the resulting position
completely equal after 10. Rc1 and the exchange on e3. The only other game in
the database continued} 10.Nc4 Nxe3 11.Nxe3 Re8 12.Rc1 Bf8 13.Rxc6 bxc6 14.Qc2

{1/2-1/2 (61) Artemiev,V (2663)-Matlakov,M (2691) Sochi 2016} ) 10.Rc1 Qd7 
{telegraphing Black's intent to exchange the g2 bishop.} 11.a3 {sort of a
waiting move, but also done to take away the b4 square from Black (usually to
prevent ...Nb4 as a reaction to Qc2).} 11...Bh3 12.Bxh3 {masters can play this
move with ease in the English, even though it looks anti-positional. If Black
could follow it up by bringing additional pieces into a kingside attack, then it
would be bad, but often the exchange on h3 simply means that Black's queen is
offsides for a while.} ( 12.b4 {is not a bad other option, but in this position
White doesn't have much more to gain beyond this move on the queenside, so
taking the time to first get Black's queen out of position is worth it.} ) 
12...Qxh3 13.b4 $14 Bd6 {this is done to protect e5 and subsequently maneuver
the Nc6, but it seems somewhat contrived, as if Black has nothing better to do.
Bringing the queen back on side with ...Qe6 or ...Qd7 would seem more
productive.} 14.Qb3 {the natural spot for the queen, which no longer faces
opposition from a bishop on the light squares and has a beautiful diagonal now;
this is another reason why Aronian was happy to exchange off the bishops.} 
14...Ne7 15.d4 {Aronian judges the time is right to release some of the pent-up
energy of his minor pieces clustered in the center and challenge/eliminate
Black's presence there.} 15...exd4 {essentially forced, as it would be more
awkward for Black to try to defend with something like ...Nc6.} 16.Bxd4 {now the
bishop has an excellent diagonal as well and cannot be easily opposed by its
Black counterpart.} 16...Nc6 {Black moves to trade off the centralized bishop.} 
17.Ne4 {White has to be careful to maintain momentum here. Piece activity is
more important than avoiding the bishop for knight swap.} ( 17.Bb2 {for example
would allow Black to get some counter-pressure with} 17...Rfe8 ) 17...Nxd4 
18.Nxd4 {White's pair of knights are doing well by being centralized, while
Black's minor pieces are comparatively restricted.} 18...Qd7 $6 {Here Giri
seeimgly invites the following sequence, by enabling the potential tactics down
the d-file.} ( 18...Be5 $5 {immediately is playable.} ) 19.Rfd1 $16 {now both of
White's rooks are in the game, while Black's are still at home. The game
illustrates the latent power of rooks when they are opposing queens (or kings)
down a file, even with multiple pieces in the way.} 19...Be5 20.Nc6 Qe8 21.Na5 
( 21.Nxe5 {is an alternate way to play that may be a more obvious one for most
(at least Class) players.} 21...Qxe5 22.Nc5 {and now Black's b- and c-pawns are
under potential threat, while Black can gobble the e-pawn. For example} 
22...Qxe2 23.Nxb7 Qe7 24.Qc3 $16 ) 21...Rb8 22.Nc5 Qc8 23.Qf3 {White builds up
single-mindedly against the b7 pawn while tying Black's pieces to its defense.} 
23...c6 24.b5 $1 {a brilliant idea to increase the pressure on the queenside,
involving an exchange sacrifice, and probably why Aronian chose the approach
with 21. Na5 in the first place. (And why for the rest of us 21. Nxe5 would
probably be the easier way to go.)} 24...Bb2 ( 24...cxb5 $2 25.Nd7 $18 {and
Black has no good options.} ) 25.bxc6 {the sharpest and most effective
continuation.} ( {Avoiding the exchange sacrifice with} 25.Rc2 {is less good, as
after} 25...cxb5 {White has to contend with the pin on the Nc5.} ) 25...Bxc1 
26.Rxc1 Qc7 ( 26...bxc6 {is shown by the engine as the least bad option, but
then} 27.Nxc6 {forks the Rb8 and the undefended e7 square (which would fork the
Black king and queen), so in this variation White can regain the exchange and
then be a clear pawn up. Giri evidently didn't like this, so went for the more
complicated game continuation.} ) 27.cxb7 $18 {although the engine shows a big
advantage for White, the winning continuation is tricky to find.} 27...Na4 
{trying to exploit the pin on the Nc5, however} 28.Ncb3 {holds everything
together.} 28...Qe7 29.Nd4 {Although Qf4 could be played immediately to good
effect, White is still handily winning with this move, which threatens a fork on
c6.} 29...Qg5 {targeting the Rc1 and Na5, but now White has a brilliant finish.} 
30.Qf4 {this works on multiple levels, as after an exchange on f4 Black would
have no defense against Ndc6 and subsequent material losses. In the game
continuation, Aronian exploits Giri's back-rank problems.} 30...Qxa5 31.Qxb8 $1 
Rxb8 32.Rc8+ Qd8 {at first this looks like it holds Black together, but after} 
33.Rxd8+ Rxd8 34.Nc6 $1 {the knight and b-pawn threats prove decisive after
all.} ( 34.Nc6 Re8 ( 34...Rd1+ 35.Kg2 Rb1 36.Nb4 {and the b-pawn queens.} ) ( 
34...Rb8 35.Nxb8 Nc5 36.Nc6 Nxb7 37.Nxa7 {and Black will not be able to stop
both the a-pawn and White's 4v3 kingside majority.} ) 35.Ne7+ Kf8 36.Nc8 $1 
{and the b-pawn queens, with a blocking motif along the 8th rank similar to the
above variation's one along the b-file.} ) 1-0
