1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.Nc3 d6 {Leningrad Dutch players use this move-order to avoid
giving a target to a quick h4-h5 attack by White.} 4.g3 ( 4.h4 {is now rarely
played, but has been highly effective, scoring 80 percent in the database,
including against strong Black players. Black can now play in the center,
however, and is not committed to g6. An example:} 4...e5 5.dxe5 dxe5 6.Qxd8+ 
Kxd8 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.e4 f4 9.g3 fxg3 10.fxg3 Bb4 11.Bg5 h6 12.Bxf6+ gxf6 13.Rc1

21.Bc2 Be6 22.Kf2 Bg5 23.b3 Bg4 24.Rd1 Rad8 25.Nc3 Rxd1 26.Bxd1 Rd8 27.Nh4 Rd2+ 
28.Kf1 Bxd1 29.Nf5+ Ke6 30.Ke1 Nd3+ {0-1 (30) Hambleton,A (2052)-Barron,M (2241)
Edmonton 2009} ) 4...g6 5.Bg2 ( 5.h4 {has never been played in this position in
the database, but the following game is an example by transposition at the
professional level.} 5...c6 6.Bg2 Qa5 7.Bd2 Qa6 8.b3 Bg7 9.d5 O-O 10.Nh3 cxd5 
11.cxd5 Nbd7 12.Nf4 Ne5 13.h5 Bd7 14.hxg6 hxg6 15.Be3 Nfg4 16.Bd2 Qb6 17.O-O 
Rfc8 18.Rc1 Bf6 19.e3 {1/2-1/2 (19) Djurhuus,R (2495)-Sahl,B (2455) Gausdal
1995} ) 5...Bg7 6.Nh3 {characteristic of the Karlsbad variation. White chooses
not to block the Bg2 and normally looks to move the knight to f4.} 6...e6 {an
uncommon move here, although e6 is played in the main line Karlsbad. The pawn
move has the dual purpose of contesting d5 and allowing Black the option of
playing an eventual . ..e5 if White pushes d5.} ( 6...c6 {scores 50 percent in
the database and is the popular choice for those not wanting to commit the
knight via ...Nc6.} ) 7.Qa4+ $146 {this early queen sortie has not been played
before in the database. Castling or playing Nf4 are the two most popular
options.} 7...c6 8.d5 O-O 9.dxe6 Bxe6 $11 {this is another idea behind the
earlier e6, to allow the pawn exchange and bishop development.} 10.Ng5 Bc8 {an
interesting choice, disallowing the knight for bishop exchange. Black's bishop
currently is quite confined, but may have good long-term prospects.} 11.O-O Qe7 
12.Qa3 Nbd7 13.Rd1 Ne8 {this sort of passive defense seems like an attempt to
bait White into overextending himself.} ( 13...h6 14.Nh3 Ne5 {and now} 15.Qxd6 
Qxd6 16.Rxd6 Nxc4 {seems good for Black.} ) 14.Be3 Ne5 {Kamsky must have seen
the following sequence (except perhaps for the move 16 variation) and evaluated
that he could play the position following the exchange sac better than his
opponent.} 15.c5 dxc5 16.Bxc5 ( 16.Nd5 {is what Houdini comes up with, a far
from obvious move that however gives White an attack.} 16...cxd5 17.Bxd5+ Kh8 
18.Bxc5 Qxg5 19.Bxf8 $16 {with strong pressure and open lines in the center for
White to exploit, for example} 19...Qf6 20.Bxg7+ Kxg7 21.Rac1 ) 16...Qxg5 17.f4 
Qf6 18.fxe5 Qxe5 19.Bxf8 ( 19.Rd8 {here would be annoying for Black, an idea
flagged by the live commentators.} ) 19...Bxf8 20.Qb3+ Kg7 $11 {Houdini
evaluates this as equal, despite the small material imbalance in White's favor.
Kamsky must have been confident that he could exploit his longer-term structural
advantages and White's weaknesses (such as the e-pawn), despite his own backward
development. The collection of pieces on the 8th rank is impressive in that
regard.} 21.Bf3 {White's first move that goes a bit astray.} ( 21.Rd8 {now
doesn't work due to} 21...Nd6 {effectively trapping the rook, forcing White to
give back the exchange.} ) ( 21.e4 {was Seirawan's idea during the live
commentary and is also Houdini's favorite. White looks to exchange off the weak
pawn, or if Black leaves it on the board, gain some control over the center.} ) 
21...Nd6 22.Na4 Nb5 23.Qd3 Be6 $15 {compare this position with three moves
earlier, Black looks much better positioned while White has essentially done
nothing constructive.} 24.Kg2 g5 {signals that Black has taken over the
initiative.} 25.Kh1 Be7 26.Qc2 g4 27.Bg2 h5 {Black now has a kingside attack
rolling with all of his pieces poised to participate (even the knight can jump
in via d4). In constrast, White's pieces are spread out and uncoordinated.} 
28.e4 h4 29.exf5 Bxf5 30.Qc4 h3 {with the pawn on h3 and open lines available
for Black's pieces to attack White's king, the end is near.} 31.Re1 hxg2+ 
32.Kxg2 Qf6 $19 {Houdini evaluates the position as the equivalent of Black being
up a piece.} 0-1
