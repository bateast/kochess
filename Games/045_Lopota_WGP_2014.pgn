1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nbd2 {this appears to have been played just to get
Black out of her standard book lines. The move itself is clearly inferior to
Nc3, among other things temporarily blocking the bishop development and limiting
the scope of the knight.} 4...Bf5 {Black continues by developing the bishop in
classic Slav style.} 5.e3 ( 5.Nh4 {seems to be the a strong choice here,
immediately challenging the bishop and leaving the f3 square open for the other
knight in the event of a piece trade.} ) 5...h6 {now the bishop has a retreat
square on h7.} 6.Ne5 ( 6.Be2 {is a more obvious follow-up, developing the piece
and preparing to castle.} ) 6...e6 7.Bd3 {evidently the point of the previous
knight move.} 7...Bxd3 8.Nxd3 Nbd7 9.b3 $146 {now out of the database. Black has
solid and thematic development, while White's appears on the awkward side.} 
9...Qa5 {Black finds an unusual way of exploiting White's offbeat development.} 
10.O-O ( 10.Bb2 $11 {would be the obvious follow-up.} ) 10...Qc3 11.Nb1 {White
chooses an unbalancing continuation, perhaps with the hope of trapping the Black
queen.} ( 11.Nb2 $11 {would avoid the following sequence, although it makes
White's minor pieces look even more awkward.} ) 11...Qxa1 12.Qc2 c5 {it is
interesting to see how White's pieces get in each other's way, preventing her
from successfully getting to the Qa1. The other problem White has to deal with
is that, having already taken one rook, the Qa1 would have no problem
sacrificing herself by taking the other rook on f1, leaving Black doing fine
material-wise.} 13.a3 $6 {White no doubt did not see fully the next sequence,
which gives Black a clear advantage.} ( 13.Nc3 dxc4 14.bxc4 ( 14.Bb2 $2 {this
idea does not work in this and similar variations.} 14...cxd3 15.Qd2 Ne4 
16.Nxe4 Qxa2 $19 ) 14...cxd4 15.exd4 Be7 16.Bf4 Qxf1+ 17.Kxf1 O-O $11 ) 
13...dxc4 14.bxc4 b5 {the key idea, attacking c4 and thereby giving the queen a
way out.} 15.cxb5 c4 $6 {pressing forward immediately. The resulting pressure
leads White to make an error, but Black could have prepared better by developing
instead.} ( 15...Rd8 {is a non-obvious move found by the engine, the point being
to target d4. For example} 16.Nc3 cxd4 17.Na2 ( 17.exd4 Rc8 18.Bb2 Qa2 $19 ) 
17...Nc5 18.Nxc5 dxe3 19.Nb7 exf2+ 20.Rxf2 Qe5 $19 ) ( 15...cxd4 {also looks
good, opening lines for Black.} 16.Qb3 Ne4 17.Bb2 Nec5 $17 ) 16.Nf4 {after this
Black has her choice of good follow-up moves.} ( 16.Bb2 {would now be OK for
White and probably the best choice.} 16...cxd3 17.Qb3 {the Black queen is
finally trapped.} 17...Qxb2 18.Qxb2 Be7 $15 ) 16...Rb8 ( 16...c3 {is found by
the engine. The main point is that b2 is taken away from White, while taking the
c3 pawn leads to problems. For example} 17.Nxc3 Rc8 18.Bb2 Qa2 19.Rc1 Qc4 $19 ) 
( 16...Nb6 $5 {is also possible.} ) 17.Bd2 {preparing to get at the queen from
the other side, but Black can effectively combat this idea.} 17...Bxa3 18.Bc3 
Bb2 19.Bxb2 Qa2 20.Nc3 Qb3 21.Qxb3 cxb3 $17 {after all the complications, Black
has emerged an exchange up.} 22.Ba3 {preventing castling and trying to prove
some compensation for the material.} 22...Nb6 23.Rb1 Nbd5 {Black's strategy is
to exchange pieces and get to a simpler endgame situation where her material
edge will give good winning chances. This will also relieve her king position,
with the centralized king becoming a benefit.} 24.Nfxd5 {White has nothing
better than to go into the series of exchanges.} 24...Nxd5 25.Nxd5 exd5 26.Rxb3 
{regaining the pawn helps some, but Black still has an obvious edge and no
longer has to worry about her king.} 26...Kd7 27.Bc5 a5 {correctly mobilizing
the pawn.} 28.Ba7 $6 {this leads directly to White's demise. Although she can
make superficial progress, once that is done Black is able to break through.} ( 
28.Kf1 $5 {White now needs to get her king into the action as well.} ) 28...Rb7 
29.b6 Rc8 $19 {the extra rook comes into play in a dominating way.} 30.Kf1 Rc1+ 
31.Ke2 Rc2+ 32.Kf3 Kc6 {now the king penetrates decisively, collaborating with
the mobile a-pawn.} 33.g4 a4 34.Rb1 a3 35.Rb3 a2 36.Ra3 Kb5 {and now White
cannot prevent the a-pawn from queening with the king's support, without giving
up her rook.} 0-1
