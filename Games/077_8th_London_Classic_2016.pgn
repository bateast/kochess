1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.dxc5 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bg4 {the standard reaction after Nf3 in
this version of the Advance variation. The ability to pin the Nf3 is one of the
benefits of playing 3...c5 rather than ...Bf5.} 6.c3 {this deters . ..Qa5 and
prepares the b-pawn advance.} ( 6.Bb5 {is the main move here.} ) 6...e6 7.b4 a6 
{preventing ...Bb5, but slowing development.} ( 7...Nge7 $5 ) 8.Nbd2 Nxe5 {this
is an earlier and an easier recovery of the pawn than is normal for Black in the
variation. White in this line has chosen to emphasize queenside play instead.} 
9.Qa4+ Nd7 {now out of the database. This move choice preserves the queens on
the board and indicates that Nakamura wants a middlegame fight.} ( 9...Qd7 {had
been tried twice before in the database, both times resulting in a loss. Most
recently:} 10.Qxd7+ Nxd7 11.Bb2 Bxf3 12.Nxf3 Be7 13.Be2 Bf6 14.O-O Ne7 15.Rab1 
O-O 16.c4 a5 17.Bxf6 gxf6 18.a3 axb4 19.axb4 Ra2 20.Rfe1 Ne5 21.cxd5 Nxf3+

Nevednichy,V (2554)-Zelcic,R (2548) Tromsoe 2014} ) 10.Ne5 Nf6 {Nakamura is not
concerned about the knight for bishop trade on g4 and continues with
development.} 11.c4 $6 {while active-looking, the main problem with this move is
that it leaves White's queenside pawns overextended, which Nakamura takes
advantage of with his next move. Presumably Topalov was looking to exchange on
d5 at some point and get rid of his doubled pawns.} ( 11.Nxg4 {is a more obvious
follow-up, obtaining the two bishops, although it doesn't offer much for White
beyond equality. Topalov is obviously trying for more, which requires the knight
to stay on e5.} 11...Nxg4 12.Be2 Qh4 $5 ( 12...Ne5 $11 ) 13.Bxg4 Qxg4 $11 ) 
11...a5 {now White cannot take on a5 or advance the b-pawn without losing the c5
pawn.} 12.Nb3 ( 12.cxd5 axb4 13.Qb5 Bxc5 $15 ) 12...axb4 {this capture is made
even more annoying for White because the Queen is tied to the pin of the Nd7,
which otherwise could take the hanging Ne5, so recapturing on b4 is not
possible.} 13.Qb5 {the only move.} 13...Be7 14.c6 {this looks a bit scary at
first, but Black emerges unscathed from the sequence rather better.} ( 14.cxd5 
{doesn't seem to work any better for White, as after} 14...O-O 15.Nxg4 ( 15.d6 
Nxe5 $17 ) 15...Nxg4 {White either must accept the loss of the c5-pawn or allow
Black to go into a dangerous-looking sequence with} 16.h3 Nxf2 ( 16...Nge5 {is
the safe alternative} ) 17.Kxf2 Bf6 18.Rb1 Rxa2+ ) 14...bxc6 $15 15.Nxc6 Qc7 
{and the b-pawn is tactically protected. White does not have sufficient
compensation for the sacrificed pawn and has no good choices at this point.} ( 
15...Qb6 $6 {looks tempting, directly protecting the b-pawn, but is worse for
Black after} 16.Be3 Qxb5 17.cxb5 $14 {and now the advanced b-pawn White has
acquired is a strength rather than a liability.} ) 16.f3 ( 16.Nxb4 $2 Rb8 
{winning material.} ) 16...Bf5 {so the bishop ends up on f5 after all, and is
nicely placed there.} 17.Nxe7 Rb8 {a key intermediate move, preserving the
b-pawn.} 18.Nxf5 $2 {now Topalov goes "all in" with the material sacrifice,
which has some shock value but favors Black.} ( 18.Qa5 {this more solid
alternative must have looked unappetizing to Topalov after} 18...Qe5+ 19.Kf2 
Kxe7 $15 ) 18...Rxb5 19.Nxg7+ Ke7 $17 {Black does not have to be in a rush to
trap the knight with ...Kf8.} 20.cxb5 Nc5 {this allows time for White to seize
the long diagonal.} ( 20...Qe5+ $1 21.Be2 Nc5 22.Rb1 Nd3+ 23.Kf1 Nxc1 24.Rxc1 
Nd7 $17 ) 21.Bb2 Nxb3 22.axb3 $11 Qf4 23.Be2 {although White must be desperate
to activate his pieces, this gives Black time to do the same, getting his rook
into play very effectively.} ( 23.Ra7+ $5 Nd7 24.Nf5+ {now the bishop's presence
on b2 is a saving grace for White.} 24...exf5 25.Rxd7+ Kxd7 26.Bxh8 $11 ) 
23...Rc8 24.Rd1 Qg5 {this looks quite threatening to both the Ng7 and g2 pawn,
but moving the rook to c2 immediately appears stronger. The Ng7 is dead anyway
and the Rc2 creates new threats.} 25.b6 $6 ( 25.O-O Qxg7 26.Bd4 {and Black may
have a slight edge, but no immediate threats.} ) 25...Rc2 26.Bxf6+ Qxf6 27.Nh5 
{a nice try at extracting the knight, but now the Black queen and rook combine
well in making new, decisive threats.} ( 27.b7 Qc3+ 28.Kf1 Qc7 {and the b-pawn
is indefensible.} ) 27...Qc3+ 28.Kf1 Qe3 $19 {now the power of the queen is
demonstrated. Black will pick up both of White's defenseless queenside pawns,
while the rook on the second rank helps paralyze White's pieces. Note how poorly
they coordinate and the fact that the Rh1 is completely out of play, with the
Nh5 not much better.} 29.Re1 Qxb6 {an easy path to victory, as White is
essentially helpless.} ( 29...d4 $5 {is the engine's preference, ramming through
the passed pawn and picking up the Be2. For example} 30.b7 d3 31.Ng3 dxe2+ 
32.Nxe2 Qb6 $19 ) 30.Nf4 Qe3 31.g3 Qxb3 {Topalov now tries to put up a fight and
activate his pieces, but it's too late. Just seeing the passed d- and b-pawns
makes it rather obvious.} 32.Kg2 Kf8 33.Kh3 Qb2 34.Rb1 Qf6 35.Rhe1 ( 35.Rxb4 
Qh6+ 36.Kg2 e5 $19 {and White loses a piece.} ) 35...e5 {again, Nakamura chooses
a straightforward winning path.} ( 35...Qf5+ {would allow Black to play a
tactical trick using the h7-b1 diagonal.} 36.Kg2 e5 37.Nxd5 Rxe2+ 38.Rxe2 Qxb1 
$19 ) 36.Nxd5 Qe6+ 37.Kg2 Qxd5 38.Rxb4 Qd2 39.Rb8+ {getting out of the queen
fork} 39...Kg7 40.Kf1 Qh6 41.Kg2 ( 41.Rb4 $5 ) 41...e4 {the correct break,
opening White's position further.} 42.Rb3 Qe6 {White's king remains the more
vulnerable one, due to Black's mobility and Q+R combination.} 43.Re3 exf3+ 
44.Kxf3 Qh3 45.Rd1 ( 45.Rh1 $2 Qf5+ 46.Kg2 Qd5+ 47.Kg1 Rc1+ 48.Bf1 Rxf1+ 
49.Kxf1 Qxh1+ ) 45...Qh5+ {a strong intermediate check that heightens the impact
of the capture on h2, with tempo.} 46.Kf2 ( 46.g4 $2 {is no help} 46...Qh3+ ) 
46...Qxh2+ 47.Kf3 Rc6 {a strong redeployment of the rook. Black again has time
to spare, with a lack of any White counterplay.} 48.Rd4 Rg6 49.g4 Rf6+ 50.Ke4 
Qh1+ 51.Kd3 Qb1+ {note how White's two rooks actually hinder rather than help
him, in the face of the queen's mobility.} 52.Kd2 Qb2+ 53.Kd3 Rc6 {and White
loses material.} 0-1
