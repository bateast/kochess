1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.Nf3 {now Black could just as easily go into a Nimzo-English
hybrid with ...Bb4, but it seems most often a QGD formation is set up from
here.} 3...d5 4.e3 {White has committed to central play and there is no longer a
potential gambit situation on the queenside, now that the c4 pawn is protected.} 
4...a6 {the move actually scores pretty well, leaving Black around 50 percent in
the database, but it seems a little slow, given White's flexibility here.} 5.b3 
{by far the most played. White develops his dark-square bishop and protects c4
again, allowing him to choose to retake with a pawn in case of an exchange and
exert more control over d5.} 5...Bd6 {a good square for the bishop, also
signaling that Black will look to use his control of e5 strategically.} ( 
5...c5 {is the usual reaction by Black. Here's an instructive and tactically
fierce game featuring GM Mamedyarov as an example:} 6.Bb2 Nc6 7.cxd5 exd5 8.Rc1 
Bg4 9.h3 Bh5 10.Na4 Nd7 11.Be2 b5 12.Nc3 Nf6 13.O-O Be7 14.a4 Bxf3 15.Bxf3 Rb8 
16.axb5 axb5 17.Ne2 Qd6 18.Nf4 Nb4 19.Ba3 Na6 20.d4 b4 21.Bb2 O-O 22.Bxd5 Nxd5 
23.dxc5 Nxc5 24.Nxd5 Rfd8 25.Qg4 Bf8 26.Nf6+ Kh8 27.Qf5 g6 28.Ne4+ {1-0 (28)
Mamedyarov,S (2801) -Georgiadis,N (2526) Biel 2018} ) 6.Bb2 O-O 7.g4 $5 {this
was a novelty in tournament play, although it has been tried several times since
with good results. The idea of sacrificing the g-pawn to open the file in this
manner is a theme encountered in other openings.} 7...Nxg4 {Black chooses to
accept the challenge head-on.} ( 7...dxc4 {is an alternative.} 8.g5 Nfd7 9.Bxc4 
$11 ) ( 7...c6 $5 {is suggested by Komodo Dragon as another way to decline the
pawn. The point is to reinforce d5 while supporting a potential ...b5 pawn
thrust.} ) 8.Rg1 f5 {Black maintains the knight outpost, at least temporarily,
while still allowing for ...Nf6 in the future. It also opens the 7th rank to
lateral defense. However, it leaves the kingside a little loose and weakens e6,
a fact which White later exploits.} 9.cxd5 e5 {Anand has given the pawn back
immediately, but now maintains the advanced e5/f5 pawn duo.} 10.h3 Nf6 11.Ng5 
{even with material equality, White needs to play actively to justify his
uncastled king and isolated h-pawn. The knight gets into the game - not being
very effective on f3 - by eyeing e6 and also clearing the diagonal for the
queen.} 11...Qe7 {covering e6 and g7.} ( 11...h6 $2 {this might be the obvious
move played at the club level, in order to kick the knight. Let's see what would
happen.} 12.Ne6 Bxe6 13.dxe6 {while at first glance White's pawn looks weak,
Black has no immediate way of dealing with it and his own f-pawn has similar
problems.} 13...Nc6 14.Qf3 {and White has threats of Bc4 and Qg2 coming up,
along with queenside castling as a possibility.} ) 12.Qf3 {this allows the queen
to move to the g-file, pressures f5, and also places it on the long diagonal.
This last point is shortly used to good effect.} ( 12.Ne6 {the engines agree
that this is best played immediately.} 12...Bxe6 13.dxe6 {and the pawn is
temporarily immune from capture due to the Bc4 skewer tactic. White can then
follow up with Qf3.} ) 12...Kh8 ( 12...e4 $5 13.Qg2 Nbd7 14.Ne6 Rf7 15.O-O-O 
$14 ) 13.Ne6 Bxe6 {now b7 is undefended.} ( 13...Rg8 {is the engines'
preference. Again, leaving the strong Ne6 in place looks counterintuitive, but
White still does well from the exchange.} ) 14.dxe6 Qxe6 15.Qxb7 {White now has
the bishop pair and his pawn structure overall is no worse than Black's.} 
15...Nbd7 16.Bc4 {a logical move, but hitting the queen is of limited utility
for White here.} ( 16.Bxa6 {pawn snatching may be possible, but Black should get
some compensation in terms of the half-open a-file and a strong center, while
White's king starts looking a bit vulnerable.} 16...e4 ) ( 16.O-O-O ) ( 16.Qc6 
) 16...Qe7 17.Qg2 Nb6 $11 {White has no more immediate threats to make and Black
has equalized. White will need to do some maneuvering to start playing
dynamically again.} 18.Be2 a5 {looking to break up White's pawns and make
inroads on the queenside.} 19.Bb5 {a good example of prophylaxis. It feels a bit
strange to move this bishop yet again, but it is the best way to prevent ...a4.} 
19...Rad8 20.Qg5 {prompting Black to respond with} 20...g6 {and now} 21.Qh6 
{prompts} 21...Ng8 22.Qg5 {White would be fine with an exchange here, so Black
returns the knight.} 22...Nf6 ( 22...Qxg5 23.Rxg5 {and now White's king position
is much improved, lacking a queen to threaten it, and with two bishops and the
half-open c-file to play with.} ) 23.Rd1 {at this point queenside castling would
not seem to be an improvement for White's king, so the center is reinforced.} 
23...e4 {this logical-looking move causes Black a few headaches, after White's
next. The long diagonal is opened and Black loses control of d4 and f4, although
gaining space.} ( 23...Qe6 {maintains Black's grip in the center.} ) 24.Qh6 
{pinning the h-pawn and threatening Rxg6.} 24...Rg8 25.Ne2 {Black now
immediately moves to contest the open long diagonal.} 25...Be5 26.Bxe5 Qxe5 
27.Nf4 $1 {the key move to give White the initiative. The Bb5 is hanging, but
White has counterplay on the kingside if that happens.} 27...g5 {an excellent
defensive pawn sacrifice by Anand, echoing Nepo's original one.} ( 27...Qxb5 
28.Nxg6+ Rxg6 29.Rxg6 Rg8 30.Rxg8+ Nxg8 31.Qe6 $14 ) 28.Rxg5 Rxg5 29.Qxg5 Rg8 
30.Qh6 {the position is still tricky here and perhaps Anand was under time
pressure, as his next move effectively loses.} 30...Rg7 $2 {this looks like a
solid defensive move, but in fact it leaves White's queen too active.} ( 
30...Rg1+ 31.Bf1 Nbd7 32.Ne2 Rg6 {and Black should be fine, his space advantage
and piece activity compensating for the pawn deficit.} ) 31.Bc4 {a subtle move
that even looks positionally wrong at first, trading off White's good bishop.} 
31...Nxc4 ( 31...Nfd5 {is the engines' recommendation, but White retains an
endgame advantage after} 32.Ke2 Nxf4+ 33.Qxf4 Qxf4 34.exf4 Nxc4 35.bxc4 $18 {as
Black can do nothing about White's plan of Rb1-b5, for example} 35...a4 36.Rb1 
Rg6 37.Rb5 Rc6 38.Rxf5 Rxc4 39.Rg5 {with what should be a winning rook endgame,
as White can transfer his rook back via g3.} ) 32.bxc4 {the b-pawn finally
fulfills its destiny. From a strategic perspective, the opening of the b-file is
also potentially very good for White, if he can get the rook on it.} 32...Qb2 
{Black looks to get his pawn back, but has to keep defending the Nf6.} ( 
32...Qd6 {does not help much either, as after Ne2 and Rb1 White is taking over
the game.} 33.Ne2 ) 33.Ke2 {White now has no real weaknesses and his pieces are
in a much better position to go after Black's king.} ( 33.Ne2 {also works,
protecting g1.} ) 33...a4 34.Ne6 {White goes back to the weak e6 square, this
time unchallenged.} 34...Rf7 35.Nf4 {this is sufficient to win without the
complications of attempting a direct attack.} ( 35.Nd8 Rg7 36.Rg1 $6 {allows
Black to keep fighting} ( 36.a3 {as in the game} ) 36...Ng4 37.hxg4 Qa3 ) 
35...Rg7 36.a3 {physically blocks Black's ...a3 and is untouchable, due to the
hanging Nf6. Essentially Black has no good moves at this point.} 36...Ne8 
{Black tries to cover everything, but is not successful.} ( 36...Qb6 {is the
engines' best try} 37.d3 Qb2+ 38.Rd2 Qc3 39.Ne6 $18 ) 37.Qc6 {forking the Ne8
and the a4 pawn, so after the next move White will be up two pawns, one of which
is the passed a-pawn, with no compensation for Black.} 1-0
