1.d4 e6 2.c4 f5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.g3 d5 5.Bg2 c6 6.Nh3 {an interesting side variation
in the Stonewall. White normally looks to dominate and place a minor piece on
f4, while happening to restrain ...g5 in the process.} 6...Bd6 {this is the
standard Modern Stonewall placement of the bishop. Black must be alert to not
playing into White's plans for the Nh3 however, for example by exchanging
bishops on f4.} 7.O-O O-O 8.Qc2 dxc4 {transforming the center and initiating
complications.} ( 8...Na6 $5 {scores best in the database, although only based
off three games, all of which were in the 1990s. It is also Komodo's preference.
In all cases, it was followed by ...dxc4. The text move appears to be the modern
choice, dispensing with the knight development, although the last occurrence was
played some four years before this game.} ) 9.e4 {White needs to play actively
in response and strikes back in the center, now that the d-pawn no longer
influences e4. The immediate threat is e4-e5.} 9...e5 {blocks White's forking
threat and challenges for the center.} 10.exf5 exd4 ( 10...Na6 {is the engine
choice, getting another piece developed and eyeing the b4 square.} 11.dxe5 Bxe5

to protect the d-pawn over the c-pawn.} ( 11...d3 $2 12.Qxc4+ $16 ) ( 11...b5

center.} ( 13.b4 $5 ) 13...Nc6 $11 {defending against the b-pawn advance.} 
14.Bf4 {although there is no longer a Nh3, the Ne2 plays a similar role in
supporting the bishop on f4. White does not attempt to protect the f5 pawn,
which would be too awkward.} ( 14.Nf7+ {seems like a good move, winning the
exchange, but is passed up by Onischuk. None of the engines like it either,
showing equality at best for White.} 14...Rxf7 15.Qxf7 Ne5 16.Qb3 Rb8 {and Black
has full compensation for the exchange with the protected passed d-pawn, 4-2
mobile queenside pawn majority, and active piece placement. White's doubled
f-pawn is also a weakness.} ) 14...Bxf5 15.Nf7+ {now White goes for the
exchange, with similar results to the above variation. There is not much of a
choice, however, since Black otherwise is just a pawn up.} 15...Rxf7 16.Qxf7 
Rb8 ( 16...d3 $5 {is recommended by both Komodo and Stockfish, showing full
equality. Perhaps Akobian did not want to enter the complications afterwards;
the text move simplifies the position and is more predictable to play. The idea
is put into practice shortly, in any case.} ) ( 16...Ne5 $2 {as in the above
variation no longer works, as there is no Bc8 now and the b-pawn is hanging.} ) 
17.Bxc6 bxc6 18.Rfe1 d3 ( 18...Rxb2 $2 {is avoided by Akobian, who no doubt
spotted the response by White to sacrifice on d4 and open up the e-file for the
Re1. This type of response is likely to be missed by Class players, who would
focus on grabbing the pawn and assume that the d-pawn is still well-protected,
without further evaluation.} 19.Nxd4 $1 {the point is that Black is forced to
deal with the knight, which is attacking the Bf5 and c6, while White also
creates threats involving the e-file.} 19...cxd4 20.Bxd6 $18 {this is White's
ultimate idea, which works due to Black's back-rank problem.} 20...Bg6 (

$2 {without the e-file open, this idea no longer works for White.} ( 19.Rad1 
{was necessary.} ) 19...Qxd6 $15 20.Nc3 d2 21.Re7 {Black is vulnerable on the
7th rank here, rather than the 8th rank, so the position is defendable.} 
21...Rg8 22.Rxa7 $6 {Onischuk evidently felt that he had time to snatch the
pawn, perhaps with the goal of advancing the a-pawn. However, this gives an
extra tempo to Black, whose own passed pawn is much farther along on d2.} ( 
22.Rd1 ) 22...Bg4 ( 22...Qd3 {is the engine recommendation, powerfully
centralizing the queen. This does multiple things, including allowing the
advance of the c5 pawn, threatening to penetrate via c2, and forcing White to
worry about his airy king position.} ) 23.Qe7 ( 23.Re7 $15 ) 23...Qxe7 {as
before, Akobian goes for a simpler position with less of an objective advantage.
This is a common practical decision, especially taking into account things like
fatigue and time management.} ( 23...Qb8 {is the engine recommendation. For
example, if} 24.Rb7 Qc8 25.Rc7 Qf5 26.Rxc6 Bf3 $19 ) 24.Rxe7 $15 Nd5 {the only
move for Black. Now the pawn threatens to queen, since Black is in a position to
remove the Nc3 and White's Re7 cannot get to the d-file to defend.} 25.Re2 $2 ( 
25.f3 {is the only saving move for White.} 25...Bxf3 {deflecting the bishop from
covering d7.} 26.Rd7 ) ( 25.Nxd5 cxd5 $19 {and White loses material after an
eventual d1(Q).} ) 25...d1=Q+ $1 0-1
