1.Nf3 g6 2.g3 c5 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.c4 Nc6 5.Nc3 {via a somewhat unusual move-order we
have arrived at a Symmetrical English. Black will follow the plan of using ...e5
to challenge for control of the center and break symmetry, while White pursues a
queenside strategy.} 5...d6 6.O-O e5 {this advance gives Black a lock on d4 and
greater central presence/control via her pawns. On the other hand, it blocks the
Bg7 and creates a hole on d5.} 7.d3 {this opens up the c1-g5 diagonal for the
bishop and also helps restrain a potential future .. .e4 advance.} 7...Nge7 
{the standard place for the knight in this variation. The knight, if placed
instead on f6, would get in the way of both the Bg7 and the f-pawn, which Black
may play to f5 at some point.} 8.a3 O-O 9.Rb1 a5 10.Bd2 {White's dark-square
bishop development in this line is somewhat problematic, in that there is no
obviously good square for it that does not also get in the way of other pieces.
Keeping it on c1 makes no sense, however, so placing it on d2 is fine and the
most common option. There it may also help control b4 when the time comes to
make a pawn break there.} 10...Rb8 11.Ne1 {initiating the standard plan of
repositioning the knight to c2, from where it is able to help White force
through the b4 break. This looks awkward at first glance, but in reality the
knight is doing little on f3 and moving it also opens up the Bg2 to good effect
on the long diagonal.} 11...Be6 {Black similarly has little scope initially for
her non-fianchettoed bishop, but there is a more obvious choice of where to
place it. From e6, it can help cover the hole on d5 in tandem with the Ne7.
Black's subsequent push of the d-pawn is also consistent with the central
strategy originally initiated by playing ...e5.} 12.Nc2 d5 13.cxd5 Nxd5 {this
recapture is always done with the knight, otherwise White would gain the
advantage of the two bishops after exchanging with the Nc3.} 14.Ne4 {an uncommon
move. Exchanging on d5 with the knight is more common, as is the alternative
Ne3.} 14...b6 {the obvious way to protect the c5 pawn.} 15.Ng5 Bc8 {naturally
Black wants to preserve the bishop and avoid giving White the two bishops.} 
16.Ne3 {a move that necessarily reflects an understanding of what is happening
on the squares g5 and b4. The game is still in the database, which interestingly
shows White scoring over 70 percent in the dozen games available, although the
position seems quite equal (including to the engine).} 16...Nxe3 ( 16...Qxg5 
17.Nxd5 Qd8 18.b4 $11 ) 17.Bxe3 Nd4 {here Black diverges from previous games,
which continued ...Bb7. The most recent example:} ( 17...Bb7 18.Nf3 Kh8 19.Qd2 
Re8 20.Rfe1 Qe7 21.Qc2 h6 22.Qc4 f5 23.Qh4 Qxh4 24.Nxh4 Kh7 25.Rec1 Rbc8 26.Kf1 
Ba8 27.Rc2 Rf8 28.Nf3 f4 29.Bd2 g5 30.Bc3 b5 31.gxf4 gxf4 32.Rbc1 Rg8 33.Be1 
{1/2-1/2 (33) Lehmann,C (2100)-Borulya,E (2293) Germany 2008} ) 18.b4 {White
finally gets in the break with the b-pawn.} 18...cxb4 19.axb4 Bg4 ( 19...a4 $5 
{is preferred by the engine. The pawn is tactically defended, as Qxa4 would be
followed by ...Nxe2.} 20.b5 Bg4 21.Nf3 ) 20.f3 {this is a committal and
seemingly antipositional move by White, who temporarily shuts off the Bg2 and
cuts off the f3 square from the Ng5. However, it's more dynamic than an
alternative like Re1.} ( 20.Nf3 $5 ) 20...Bd7 21.Ne4 axb4 $6 {although Black
still has a passed pawn after this trade, having an outside passed pawn on the
a-file would be a greater advantage.} ( 21...a4 {is now an even stronger idea
than before, since the passed pawn is protected by the Bd7.} ) 22.Bxd4 exd4 
23.Qb3 {White correctly is not in a rush to recapture the pawn, choosing to
develop her queen first in an effective manner.} 23...Re8 {lining up against the
undefended e2 pawn and pinning the knight. This also frees up the f8 square for
a bishop retreat.} 24.f4 {interestingly this appears to be White's only good
move. It frees up the Bg2, most obviously, and her other pieces are already
optimally placed.} ( 24.Qxb4 $2 {this would lift the pin on the f-pawn, to
White's detriment.} 24...f5 25.Nd2 Rxe2 $17 ) 24...Bf8 ( 24...h6 {would be a
prophylactic move, taking away the g5 square from the knight.} ) 25.Ng5 
{another example of a patient master-level move. While Black has protected the
b4 pawn, her pawn structure in the center and queenside is shattered and too
vulnerable to protect in the long term. This means that White need not worry
about the material deficit. Instead, she now starts a threat of her own against
the weak f7 square. This threat trumps the previous pin of the knight against
the e2 pawn, which we therefore can say has been tactically broken.} 25...Be6 
{an inaccuracy which allows White to gain some traction.} ( 25...Qf6 {or ...Qe7
defends the f7 pawn without allowing the minor piece exchange as in the game.} 
26.Bd5 Rxe2 27.Nxf7 Kg7 $11 ) ( 25...Re7 {is also possible.} 26.Bd5 Be8 27.f5 
Rxe2 28.Nxf7 Bxf7 29.Bxf7+ Kh8 $11 ) 26.Nxe6 fxe6 {in contrast with the above
variations, Black no longer has the threat of ...Rxe2 because of the pawn on
e6.} 27.f5 ( 27.Bc6 $5 Re7 28.Qxb4 {might be a simpler approach, regaining the
pawn with the idea of pursuing play on the queenside. In the game, White instead
prefers to increase pressure on the kingside.} ) 27...gxf5 28.Rxf5 {taking
advantage of the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal.} 28...Rc8 {the best way to improve
Black's position. She can't do anything about all of the air in front of her
king, but she can activate the rook on the open file.} 29.Bd5 {an excellent,
master-level move. White increases the pressure on the diagonal in the most
effective way, while the bishop cannot be taken for tactical reasons.} 29...Qd6 
{Black appears to be trying to hold onto the extra material, in this case the b4
pawn, rather than placing her pieces on the most effective squares.} ( 
29...exd5 $2 30.Rxd5 {and Black will lose material, due to the discovered double
check threat.} ) ( 29...Qd7 $5 ) 30.Rg5+ Kh8 31.Be4 {the bishop now needs to be
moved, with the tactical threat of discovered check no longer there.} 31...Rc5 
32.Rg4 {exchanging on c5 would just help Black get her pawn structure in order.} 
32...b5 {I'm not sure of the point of this, which may simply be a waiting move.
If so, bringing the rook back to c7 would create fewer potential problems, as
we'll see shortly.} 33.Rf1 {bringing another major piece into the kingside
attack.} 33...Rc3 34.Rf7 {threatening mate on h7.} 34...Rc7 {now we see why this
would have been better played earlier, as Black is simply a tempo down.} 35.Rf5 
{again using tactical themes involving the e6 pawn. The pawn remains pinned, but
this time against the mating square g8 rather than the Black king.} 35...Bh6 $6 
{under pressure, Black finally cracks. She was probably focused on getting rid
of the mate threat on g8, which is now covered by the Re8. She also probably saw
the threats she could make after placing the bishop on e3, but White is able to
easily parry them.} ( 35...Rc5 ) 36.Rxb5 $16 {now we see another drawback of
Black's move 32. She now has no material compensation for her positional
difficulties.} 36...Be3+ 37.Kg2 Qf8 38.Bf3 {shutting down any threats on the
f-file.} 38...Rc1 39.Qxb4 {ignoring the check on g1. This is also a
characteristic of master-level play, as amateurs too often are afraid of
checks.} 39...Rg1+ 40.Kh3 {emotionally these kind of moves can feel awkward and
scary, as the king has very limited squares. However, calculation shows that
Black has run out of threats.} 40...Qf7 $2 {it's not obvious at first glance why
this is bad, although White is able to quickly achieve a won position. Black
does not realize that she has effectively given up control over the 8th rank.} 
( 40...Qxb4 {is judged best by the engine, although it will likely result in a
winning endgame for White.} ) 41.Qd6 $18 {and there is nothing Black can do to
avoid mate or major material losses. The immediate threat is Qe5+, while the
queen can also support exchanging off the Re8.} ( 41.Rb8 {is probably the
easiest winning continuation to spot, although the text move is more elegant and
decisive. The problem for Black is that her back rank is under-defended, given
the control of the Rg4 over the g-file and Black's king in the corner.} 
41...Qh5+ 42.Rh4 Qf5+ 43.g4 Qf7 44.Qb7 Qxb7 45.Rxe8+ Kg7 46.Bxb7 $18 ) 41...Qf6 
( 41...Bh6 42.Qxd4+ Bg7 43.Qxg1 $18 ) 42.Rb8 Qh6+ 43.Rh4 Qg6 44.Rxe8+ Qxe8 
{unfortunately for Black, getting rid of the 8th rank threat has now left her
vulnerable again on the a1-h8 diagonal.} 45.Qe5+ Kg8 46.Rg4+ 1-0
