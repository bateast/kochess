1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c6 4.e3 f5 {this is a typical way master-level players
reach the Dutch Stonewall, avoiding various sidelines that White could play
after starting with 1...f5.} 5.Bd3 {normally in the man line White fianchettoes
this bishop against the Stonewall. Here he's already played e3, so now g3
followed by Bg2 could be considered a waste of time, and create a positional
weakness on the light squares.} 5...Nf6 6.O-O Bd6 7.b3 Qe7 {a standard response
from Black; White otherwise can play Ba3, intending to exchange the Bd6 and
leaving Black weak on the dark squares.} 8.Bb2 O-O 9.Nc3 Bd7 {this is played
only a handful of times in the database, but is nevertheless considered "hot"
because of recent high-level games, including this one. Black intends to follow
the old Stonewall development plan with the light-square bishop, swinging it to
the kingside. As we'll see later on, however, it never quite makes it there.} ( 
9...Ne4 {is the overwhelming choice here.} ) ( 9...Nbd7 {also looks reasonable.} 
) 10.Ne5 Be8 $146 11.Ne2 {this looks a little curious, but it lets the Bb2 add
its support to e5, anticipating Black's next move.} 11...Nbd7 12.f3 {taking away
the e4 square from Black.} 12...c5 {the Stonewall pawn formation is not intended
to be a static structure for the whole game. Part of playing it well is knowing
when to look for pawn breaks and exchanges in the center. By now Black has
mostly finished his development and can support the text move.} 13.Rc1 Rd8 
14.Qc2 dxc4 15.Bxc4 cxd4 16.exd4 Nb6 {Black now controls d5 and can blockade and
pressure the isolated d-pawn. Envisioning this was part of the idea behind
Black's earlier ...Rd8.} 17.Nf4 {targeting Black's weak e6 pawn in turn. Now
Black could also defend by blocking on d5, which would transform the central
pawn structure, but he prefers to keep White's pawn isolated on an open file.} 
17...Nxc4 ( 17...Nbd5 18.Nxd5 Nxd5 19.Bxd5 exd5 20.Rfe1 $14 {White's game is
easier and Black will have to play somewhat defensively, but this appears to be
at best only a slight plus for White.} ) 18.Qxc4 ( 18.bxc4 $5 {is preferred by
the engine. Black could then exchange on e5 immediately, for example} 18...Bxe5 
19.dxe5 Nd7 {and White's e- and c-pawns look like long-term weaknesses, which
may have been what put off Gelfand. He would have some dynamic play in return,
for example on the a3-f8 diagonal, and the initiative. Komodo 8 judges the
position a clear (if small) plus for White.} ) 18...Bd7 ( 18...Bf7 $5 ) 19.Nxd7 
{otherwise Black has no troubles.} ( 19.Rfe1 {supporting the knight (or with
Qe2) allows Black to exchange major pieces on the c-file and free up his game.} 
19...Rc8 20.Qd3 Rxc1 21.Bxc1 Rc8 $11 ) 19...Bxf4 {a key in-between move and not
the only one of the sequence that is now triggered.} ( 19...Rxd7 20.Qxe6+ Qxe6 
21.Nxe6 Re8 22.Nc5 Rde7 $14 {Black has compensation in the form of the e-file
and better bishop, but a pawn is still a pawn.} ) 20.Nxf8 Bxc1 21.Nxe6 Be3+ 
{another necessary in-between move.} 22.Kh1 b5 {a deflection tactic that
essentially forces the queen trade.} 23.Qc7 Qxc7 24.Nxc7 b4 25.d5 {the pawn is
still eventually doomed.} 25...Bb6 26.Bxf6 gxf6 27.Rc1 a5 28.g3 Bxc7 29.Rxc7 
Rxd5 {the players have now reached a drawn rook ending. Black's king can easily
cover the weaknesses on the kingside and Black's rook is too active for White to
make any progress.} 30.Rc2 Kf7 31.Kg2 1/2-1/2
