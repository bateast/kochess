1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Qa4+ {recovering the pawn immediately is
normal here, although White can head for a true gambit by castling.} 5...Nbd7 
6.Qxc4 c5 7.Qb3 {while not necessary at this point, repositioning the queen can
be done with the text move or Qc2.} 7...Rb8 {Black will eventually want to
develop with ...b6 and ...Bb7, so getting the rook out of the way of the Bg2 is
a prerequisite.} 8.d3 Bd6 9.Nc3 a6 {taking away the b5 square from the Nc3, a
necessary prophylactic move.} 10.Nd2 {this is a somewhat unusual idea and
follows most recently the game Seirawan-Kaidanov (2012). The Bc1 is blocked in
temporarily, but the knight will be repositioned on e4.} 10...O-O 11.O-O b6 
12.Nde4 Nxe4 13.Nxe4 Be7 {the game now diverges, to White's favor, as Black's
bishop is more passive.} ( 13...Be5 14.Bd2 Nf6 15.Bc3 Bxc3 16.bxc3 Nxe4 17.Bxe4

otherwise White can follow up effectively with Nd6.} 15.Be3 Bb7 16.f4 {here
Komodo 8 prefers the plan of disrupting Black's queenside pawn majority, using
the a-pawn as a lever. This was also played in the following game, having
reached the same position by transposition.} ( 16.a4 Bxe4 17.Bxe4 a5 18.Bd2 Bg5

53.Kc5 Kh5 54.Kb4 Rxe3 55.Rc3 {1-0 (55) Vaganian,R (2590)-Enders,P (2475)
Germany 1992} ) 16...Bxe4 17.Bxe4 Nf6 18.Bf3 exf4 19.gxf4 {a big strategic
decision on how to recapture. White creates a half-open g-file, likelier to
create additional opportunities against her opponent's king, but also weakening
her own shield.} 19...Qd7 20.Kh1 {the obvious follow-up, otherwise the g-file
will do White no good.} 20...Ng4 ( 20...h5 {is an interesting idea here,
establishing an outpost for the knight before launching it into enemy
territory.} ) 21.Bg1 {White now has to block the g-file of her own accord, in
order to preserve the two bishops and keep her defenses intact.} 21...Rfd8 
{this is problematic, as it leaves f7 weakened.} ( 21...Bf6 $5 ) 22.Rad1 Bf6 
23.d4 {a masterly move. Doing the simple math of taking on d4, this looks
suicidal, but White recognizes that her opponent's pieces are overloaded and she
can strike in the center.} 23...cxd4 24.e4 Nh6 25.Rd3 {White chooses not to
follow up with the immediate e5, preferring to do some maneuvering with her
pieces first, building up their attacking potential.} ( 25.e5 Be7 26.Rxd4 
{would regain the pawn immediately, but likely lead to simplifications. For
example} 26...Qh3 27.Be2 Qxb3 28.axb3 Bc5 29.Rxd8+ Rxd8 30.Bxc5 bxc5 $11 {White
can now capture the a6 pawn, but then Black's rook would be able to camp on the
second rank.} ) 25...Qe6 ( 25...g6 $5 {is a defensive idea that could be good
for Black, giving the bishop a retreat square on g7.} ) 26.Qd1 {White decides to
preserve her queen and offer a second pawn.} ( 26.Rfd1 {is perhaps the more
natural move, as Black gains little or nothing by exchanging on b3.} ) 
26...Qxa2 27.Rf2 Rbc8 ( 27...Qe6 {is a retreat that could be played now or in
the near future, that would bring the queen back into play on the kingside for
defense.} ) 28.Rg2 Qc4 29.Rgd2 {White evidently has second thoughts about
pursuing a kingside strategy and switches back to the center, although this is
effectively a loss of tempo with the rook.} ( 29.e5 Be7 30.Be4 $11 ) 29...Qc1 
$15 30.Qe2 {White is consistent in not wishing to trade queens, until forced
to.} 30...Be7 31.f5 {finally the mobile center pawns start rolling.} 31...f6 ( 
31...Bf6 ) 32.Rd1 Qc2 33.R3d2 Qc4 34.Qxc4+ {White now decides to get a pawn
back.} ( 34.Rxd4 $5 ) 34...Rxc4 35.Be2 Rb4 36.Bxa6 Bc5 {Black has now reasonably
consolidated her extra pawn, although it will certainly be a continuing target
on d4.} 37.b3 {possible due to all of Black's pieces being tied to protecting
the advanced d-pawn.} 37...Kf8 38.Bc4 Ke7 $6 {this slip costs a tempo, as the
king has to retreat to protect the pawn again.} ( 38...Nf7 {would allow Black to
follow up with either ...Ng5 or ...Nd6, as needed.} ) 39.Rg2 Kf8 40.Bf2 Nf7 
41.Bg3 Ng5 {Black here appears primarily concerned about blocking threats along
the g-file.} ( 41...Nd6 42.Bxd6+ Bxd6 43.Rdg1 ( 43.Rxd4 $2 b5 $19 ) 43...Rd7 
$15 ) 42.Bd5 $11 {an excellent move, cutting off the Rd8 and centralizing the
bishop, which is unchallenged on the light squares.} 42...Bd6 43.Bxd6+ Rxd6 
44.Ra2 ( 44.h4 $5 ) ( 44.Rd3 {also seems logical, protecting the third rank and
preparing for transfer to g3 along with the threat of h4.} ) 44...Rd7 45.Ra8+ 
Ke7 46.Kg2 Nf7 ( 46...Rc7 {is a subtle move, but one that ends up costing Black
less.} 47.Bc4 b5 48.Rb8 Kd6 49.Rxd4+ Ke5 50.Rd1 Kxe4 $15 ) 47.Rg8 Ne5 48.Rxg7+ 
{while the engine shows complete equality here, the momentum is on White's side
and she has the easier game.} 48...Kd6 49.Rg8 d3 50.Kf2 Ra7 51.Rd2 Kc5 52.Ke3 
{note how both players emphasize king activity in the center.} 52...Rb5 ( 
52...Ra1 ) 53.Rc8+ Kb4 54.Rxd3 $1 {this is not forcing - the engine finds a
reasonable defense for Black, even a pawn down - but the decision to offer the
exchange sacrifice is a winning one and psychologically hard to turn down.} 
54...Nxd3 ( 54...Rc5 55.Rxc5 bxc5 56.Rd2 Kc3 ) 55.Kxd3 $16 {Komodo 8 now has
White a full pawn equivalent ahead in its evaluation, despite being materially a
pawn down. White's bishop is magnificent and her king is better centralized. The
ending remains tricky, however.} 55...Ra1 56.Rc6 Rd1+ 57.Ke3 Rbxd5 {Black
decides to return material, but exchanges down into an inferior ending. Compare
this with the pawn-down position from the move 54 variation and it's obvious
White is much better.} ( 57...Re1+ $5 ) 58.exd5 b5 59.Rxf6 Rxd5 60.Ke4 Rd2 
61.Rh6 Kxb3 62.f6 $18 {White's advanced passed pawn will decide the game.}

76.Re1 Ra2 77.Ke7 {and Black will have to give up the rook for the f-pawn.} 1-0
