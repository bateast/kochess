1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 {instead of playing d4 and heading for a standard queen
pawn opening, White switches to an English continuation.} 3...Bb4 {the
Nimzo-English.} 4.Qc2 {unlike the Nimzo-Indian, where the text move is merely
one option among several major lines, White overwhelmingly chooses Qc2 (and
sometimes Qb3) in the English, to preserve his pawn structure after Bxc3; g3 is
the one popular alternative to this approach.} 4...O-O 5.a3 Bxc3 {otherwise the
bishop move has simply been a loss of time.} 6.Qxc3 b6 7.e3 Bb7 8.b3 {White has
a choice in this line between playing b3 or b4; one or the other will be
necessary to develop with Bb2. The text move is the more solid way to play, with
b4 grabbing a little more space.} 8...d6 9.Bb2 Nbd7 10.Be2 Nc5 {one of the
differences between this line and the b4 line is that Black has c5 available for
the knight, even if only temporarily.} 11.d4 Nce4 {the e4 square is normally key
in the Nimzo and Black takes advantage of her dominance of it.} 12.Qc2 c5 
{challenging White's pawn center.} 13.O-O {White wisely chooses to remove her
king before initiating action in the center.} 13...Rc8 {the opening phase is
over and both sides need to come up with their middlegame plans here.} 14.Rad1 
{White's choice of which rook to move indicates that she is more interested in
central and kingside play than in the queenside.} 14...Qe7 15.dxc5 Rxc5 {this is
a somewhat unusual choice for recapturing, but Black apparently wanted to avoid
the below variation. The rook move perhaps would be better justified if Black
could swing her rook over to the kingside.} ( 15...Nxc5 {and now} 16.Bxf6 gxf6 
( 16...Qxf6 17.Rxd6 ) 17.Nd2 f5 {is evaluated as equal by Houdini. Human players
would of course dislike to see their pawn structure compromised, but in this
case it doesn't seem like White can successfully exploit the holes on the
kingside.} ) 16.b4 ( 16.Nd2 {is Houdini's preference, with the aim of getting
rid of the Ne4.} ) 16...Rcc8 17.Qb3 {with tactical threats nonexistent, the
middlegame enters a maneuvering phase. This is similar to what normally occurs
in the Hedgehog and the position shares some characteristics of that.} 
17...Rfd8 18.Bd4 {this move seems largely designed to provoke Black's response.} 
18...e5 19.Bb2 {the d6/e5 pawn formation is now weaker and less flexible than
the d6/e6 pawn center, especially with the backwards d6 pawn on the half-open
file. It is currently well-guarded, but in the long run that could be a
weakness. The e5 advance more importantly for the shorter term also creates a
hole on d5 which White, if she can, will try to exploit.} 19...Qe6 {Black
recognizes the weakness of d5 and moves to reassert control over it, also
putting the queen in an excellent central location on the a2-g8 and h3-c8
diagonals.} 20.Rc1 b5 {attempting to force the issue of the fate of the
queenside pawns, taking advantage of the pin against the Qb3.} 21.Qd3 {the only
good response.} 21...bxc4 22.Rxc4 Bd5 {further exchanges on c4 are not in
Black's interest, as her structural weakness at d6 would become much more
evident with fewer pieces on the board.} 23.Rcc1 ( 23.Rxc8 Rxc8 24.Rc1 Rxc1+ 
25.Bxc1 {would be an alternate way to play, but without the rooks on the board
White does not have a good way to take advantage of the open c-file or increase
pressure down the d-file.} ) 23...Rb8 24.Qa6 {While the position is still equal,
White starts to pick up a slight initiative by making threats Black needs to
respond to. The 2-to-1 majority on the queenside and the open c-file are things
White can use to try for an eventual advantage, as well as the half-open
d-file.} 24...Rb7 25.h3 {apparently intended to prevent ...Ng4 before moving the
rook, but Houdini points out a tactical way for White to refute that.} ( 
25.Rfd1 Ng4 26.Rxd5 {not an obvious move} 26...Qxd5 27.Bc4 {and rather
surprisingly the queen has no squares.} ) 25...Qe7 {Black starts to face
difficulties in an increasingly complex and tactical position. Here she retreats
her queen to a much less active square.} ( 25...Rdb8 {is Houdini's suggestion as
an alternate method of overprotecting the Rb7, necessary to allow the Bd5
mobility.} ) 26.Rfd1 {it's worth observing how White's rooks and other pieces
are working together and are well-placed to apply further pressure, while
Black's more scattered and less cohesive pieces that are more oriented towards
defense.} 26...Bb3 {Houdini flags this as Black's first major error, given the
tactic available on move 29.} ( 26...Rbd7 ) 27.Rd3 Rb6 28.Qa5 Be6 29.Nd2 ( 
29.Bxe5 {is the tactic Houdini finds, based on a discovered back-rank mate
threat.} 29...dxe5 $2 30.Qxa7 {and White is going to pick up one of Black's
rooks, for example} 30...Nd7 31.Rxd7 Bxd7 32.Qxb6 $18 ) 29...h6 {Black now
avoids future back-rank problems.} 30.Nf1 ( 30.Bf3 {would be an immediate way to
fight for the e4 square.} ) 30...Ne8 31.f3 Nc5 32.bxc5 ( 32.Rxc5 {is the capture
preferred by Houdini, made possible by a pin tactic against the Rb6.} 32...dxc5 
33.Rxd8 Qxd8 34.bxc5 Rb8 35.Qxd8 Rxd8 ) 32...Rxb2 33.Nd2 {now White's pieces are
looking rather uncoordinated, especially by comparison to the position on move
26. Houdini awards Black a slight plus here. Black has the open b-file and
White's c5 pawn is isolated and weak.} 33...Rdb8 $6 {this lets White off the
hook in the center and drops the e5 pawn for insufficient compensation.} ( 
33...Rc8 $15 {seems good for Black, immediately targeting the c-pawn, which is
pinned to the hanging Rc1.} ) 34.cxd6 Nxd6 35.Qxe5 R8b6 36.Bf1 {White extricates
her bishop from the pin on the second rank.} 36...R2b5 37.Qc3 {White has
improved her piece placement by reorganizing over the last few moves and Black
has no obvious counterplay.} 37...Qg5 {this allows White to complete her
consolidation and achieve a winnin position.} ( 37...Rb2 ) 38.Rxd6 Rxd6 39.Ne4 
Qd5 $2 {this just drops a rook.} ( 39...Rb3 $16 ) 40.Bxb5 Rb6 41.Bc4 1-0
