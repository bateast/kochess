1.d4 g6 2.e4 Bg7 {In round 7, Paikidze played the Modern as Black and lost. An
interesting psychological choice of Yip, to go into the same defense.} 3.Nc3 d6 
4.Nf3 {the usual choices here are Be3 and f4.} 4...a6 {Black actually has a
significant plus with this line in the database.} 5.a4 Nd7 6.Bc4 e6 7.Bg5 
{White scores an astonishing 25 percent in the database with this.} 7...Ne7 
{Black is going for the full Hippopotamus setup.} 8.Qd2 h6 9.Be3 {the bishop
returns, having provoked ...h6, which is something Black likely wanted to do
anyway.} 9...b6 10.h3 Bb7 {we now have the full Hippo. The round 7 game saw an
earlier deviation by Paikidze as Black.} 11.O-O Nf6 12.d5 {breaking the symmetry
in the center. Now Black must decide on whether she wants a more closed game.} 
12...e5 {the answer is yes. Strategically, White has a significant space
advantage. However, Black with a closed center can now start operations on the
kingside without worrying about a breakthrough in the center by White.} 13.Nh2 
Nh5 14.Rfe1 {this clears f1 for use by White's minor pieces, but the rook is
doing less on the e-file and appears misplaced there.} 14...g5 ( 14...f5 $5 {is
a natural-looking pawn break, but Black evidently prefers to continue
emphasizing piece play on the kingside.} ) 15.g3 {while helping control f4, this
pawn move does not seem necessary and weakens h3.} ( 15.Ne2 $5 ) 15...Ng6 
{getting one of Black's other pieces developed or re-deployed seems more useful,
for example ...Bc8 or ...Qd7.} 16.Qd1 {e2 seems like a better square, also
targeting h5 while keeping the rooks connected and also forming a battery on the
more useful f1-a6 diagonal.} 16...Nf6 17.Bf1 {covering the h3 weakness and with
the idea of re-developing the bishop in a fianchetto.} 17...Bc8 {bishop was
doing nothing on b7.} 18.a5 {logically playing on the queenside, where White has
a space advantage. However, she then turns atteniton to the kingside and it
becomes Black's game strategically.} 18...b5 {consistent with previous
decisions, keeping the game closed.} 19.Bg2 ( 19.Bd2 {followed by Na2 with
either c4 or Nb4 is the plan suggested by the engine, mobilizing White's
queenside pieces.} ) 19...Bd7 {Black has limited ways to make progress. This
allows the formation of a battery on the c8-h3 diagonal.} 20.Nf1 Qc8 21.Kh2 
{forced, to protect the h-pawn.} 21...h5 {White can safely ignore Black's offer
of the g5 pawn on the kingside and follow a queenside strategy, as the h/g pawn
duo cannot break through. However, White chooses to focus on the kingside, with
diastrous results.} 22.f4 $2 {now Black can open up the game to her great
benefit, with the f4 square as the pivot.} 22...gxf4 23.gxf4 exf4 24.e5 {White
must have over-estimated this move, which is immediately refuted by the game
continuation. However, other continuations by Black also win.} 24...Ng4+ $19 
{an excellent breakthrough sacrifice.} ( 24...fxe3 25.exf6 Bxf6 26.Rxe3+ Be5+ 
$19 ) 25.hxg4 hxg4+ 26.Kg1 dxe5 {with three connected, advanced passed pawns for
the piece Black has a won game, with White's king position also a factor.} ( 
26...Bxe5 $5 {also works, with Black not having to worry about the d-file.} ) 
27.Bc5 Qd8 {time to mobilize the queen, heading for h4 at the earliest
opportunity.} 28.Ne4 f5 {controlling e4, although Black has to be a little
careful not to take prematurely.} 29.d6 {White's last hope. This opens the long
diagonal and makes possible a bishop fork on e4, of the Ng6 and Ra8. Black
therefore calmly eliminates the tactic.} 29...c6 30.Bb6 {White has nothing left
except to harass Black's queen temporarily.} 30...Qh4 31.Bf2 Qh5 32.Qd3 ( 
32.Ned2 Kf7 {and Black can consolidate her victory at leisure.} ) 32...fxe4 
33.Bxe4 Nf8 {not necessary, but anything wins at this point. No reason not to be
prudent.} 34.Bd4 f3 {naturally Black does not take the sacrifice and open lines
to her king. Now ...Qh1+ is threatened.} 35.Bxf3 gxf3 0-1
