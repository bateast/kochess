1.c4 c6 2.e4 {now we have a Caro-Kann} 2...d5 {virtually the only response that
makes sense after 1...c6, although I suppose one could transpose eventually into
a Modern Defense or the like without ...d5.} 3.exd5 cxd5 4.cxd5 {this keeps the
opening in its own unique variation.} ( 4.d4 {is another transpositional
alternative, this time to the Panov-Botvinnik Attack.} ) 4...Nf6 ( 4...Qxd5 {is
the main alternative, but White scores 68 percent in the database afterwards.
The Black queen will inevitably lose time relocating from d5.} ) 5.Nc3 Nxd5 
6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Bb5 {all natural developing moves by White so far.} 7...g6 
{although not used very often, this variation scores far better than its more
classical counterparts, ...Nxc3 and ...e6.} 8.Qa4 Qd6 {an interesting choice
that requires careful evaluation of the next sequence.} ( 8...Nb6 $5 {is almost
always played here.} 9.Bxc6+ bxc6 10.Qxc6+ Bd7 11.Qe4 Bg7 $11 {almost all of the
database games from this point end in a draw, with Black's compensation for the
pawn including the two (outstanding) bishops, play against the isolated d-pawn,
and good avenues for the rooks.} ) ( 8...Bd7 $4 9.Nxd5 $18 ) 9.Ne4 {now we are
in new opening territory.} 9...Qe6 10.Ng5 Qd7 11.Nc5 Qc7 $11 {at the end of the
forcing sequence, White has kicked around the Black queen, but Black is not
really behind in development, as she will have an easy time getting her bishops
out, compared to the Bc1. White's minor pieces are all forward deployed, but not
working together particularly well. Komodo assesses the position as equal, but
White is the one who can misstep more easily here.} 12.O-O ( 12.Qd4 $5 {is the
engine's recommendation.} 12...Nf6 13.Qc4 e6 $11 ) 12...Bg7 $15 {Black is now
starting to look more dangerous, as the Bg7 is now a monster on the long
diagonal and White has no real threats.} 13.Bc4 Qd8 {the best way of maintaining
the tension in the center, not afraid of the following sequence.} 14.Nxb7 Bxb7 
15.Qb5 O-O {a cold-bloodedly correct move.} 16.Qxb7 Ndb4 {eyeing the c2 square
and restricting the White queen.} 17.Qb5 Rb8 18.Qa4 Ne5 {for the cost of the
sacrificed b-pawn, Black has far more piece activity, while for White the Bc1
and Ra1 are not playing.} 19.Be2 {this is too passive.} ( 19.d3 $5 {would give
back material in order to get the Bc1 and Rf1 into the game.} 19...Nbxd3 20.Rd1 
Nxc4 21.Qxc4 Ne5 $15 ) 19...Ned3 $17 ( 19...Nbd3 $5 {also looks good.} ) 20.Nf3 
{it is remarkable to compare this position with the one on move 11, as all of
White's pieces have retreated while Black's have advanced, and now White is
behind in development.} 20...e5 {Black has an excellent position, but it's not
clear exactly what plan is best. Dominating the c-file looks good, while taking
the b2 pawn at this point does not. In the game, Goryachkina with this move
chose to occupy the enter with the e-pawn. She must have also calculated the
next sequence as part of it, perhaps even playing the text move to encourage her
opponent to challenge the Nb4.} ( 20...Rc8 $5 ) ( 20...Nxb2 $6 21.Bxb2 Bxb2 
22.Rab1 Nd5 23.Qxa7 $11 ) 21.a3 $6 {White must have been feeling a little
desperate by this point.} ( 21.Bxd3 {would have helped White gain some
maneuvering room and eliminated one of the two forward-deployed knights, at the
cost of a pawn.} 21...Nxd3 22.Ne1 Nxb2 $15 ) 21...Nf4 {a forced move for Black
in response, creating a counter-threat against the Be2 while the Nb4 is
hanging.} 22.Bd1 Nbd3 {now the Nb4 has a place to go and Black is even more
dominant. White has no good moves available, although the engine suggests Ne1 as
the best defense.} 23.g3 Nc5 {a "good enough" type of move that preserves
Black's advantage.} ( 23...e4 {is what the engine prefers. It would take
advantage of the e-pawn's position and launch a decisive attack. For example} 
24.gxf4 exf3 25.Bxf3 Re8 {and the f-pawn will eventually fall while Black
remains dominant positionally. However, this requires a number of moves to fully
unfold and in practical terms it does not look easy to clearly evaluate the
situation at the board.} ) 24.Qc4 Nfd3 25.Bc2 e4 $1 $19 {now the pawn advances
to good effect, sacrificing itself to achieve Black's complete piece dominance.} 
26.Bxd3 Nxd3 27.Qxe4 Re8 28.Qa4 {this immediately lets Black's queen into d5,
but White has severe problems in any case.} ( 28.Qc4 Rc8 29.Qb3 Re4 {and now the
rook can transfer to the c-file and pressure the trapped Bc1.} ) 28...Qd5 
29.Nh4 ( 29.Kg2 Re1 $19 ) ( 29.Qd1 Bxb2 30.Bxb2 Nxb2 31.Qc2 Rec8 32.Qb1 Qxf3 
$19 ) 29...Nxf2 {and Black can follow up with ...Re1 and/or ...Bd4 to end the
game.} 0-1
