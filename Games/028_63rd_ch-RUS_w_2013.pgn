1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 {taking the pawn is the most challenging line,
although if White is unfamiliar with the opening, the text move may be safer.} 
4...Nc6 5.Be2 cxd4 {Black eliminates the possibility of a delayed capture on
c5.} 6.cxd4 Qb6 ( 6...Bf5 {is the other alternative, where Black chooses to
delay developing the queen. For example} 7.Nf3 e6 8.O-O Nge7 9.Qa4 Qd7 10.Nc3 
Bg4 11.Be3 Nf5 12.h3 Bxf3 13.Bxf3 Ncxd4 14.Bd1 Nc6 15.Bf4 Bc5 16.Rc1 Bb6 17.Qa3

Walter Travella,G (2055)-Illescas Cordoba,M (2640) Barcelona 1996} ) 7.Nf3 ( 
7.Nc3 {is normally played here, the idea being to force Black to close the
diagonal for the light-square bishop.} 7...e6 ( 7...Qxd4 8.Nxd5 Qxd1+ 9.Bxd1 
Rb8 10.Nf3 $14 ) 8.Nf3 Nge7 {and this now looks like a standard French defense,
with a positional plus for White.} ) 7...Bg4 {Black does not waste the
opportunity to get the bishop out.} 8.O-O e6 9.Nbd2 Nh6 {the knight is going to
f5, so this is a typical idea in this type of position.} 10.h3 Bxf3 {normally
Black exchanges off the bishop in this situation. Time would be lost with a
bishop retreat and it is "bad" in any case because of the pawn structure.} 
11.Nxf3 Nf5 12.Be3 Nxe3 13.fxe3 {this is not in fact a bad structure for White,
who now has a half-open f-file and full protection for the d4 pawn.} 13...Be7 
14.Rb1 {White signals a plan involving queenside pawn expansion.} ( 14.Qd2 
{seems more flexible.} ) 14...O-O 15.b4 f6 {another thematic move for Black,
attacking the head of the White pawn chain.} ( 15...Nxb4 $2 16.a3 ) 16.b5 Na5 ( 
16...Nxe5 {is an interesting tactical alternative.} 17.dxe5 Qxe3+ 18.Kh1 fxe5 
{and Houdini evalutes the position as equal, although obviously a lot of play
can be had with the piece versus 3 pawns situation.} ) 17.Qd2 Rfc8 18.exf6 
{White chooses to conduct the exchange of the e-pawn on her terms. Otherwise,
the Nf3 is essentially bound to protect e5, since a pawn exchange initiated by
Black would then create two weak e-pawns.} 18...Bxf6 19.Nh2 Nc4 20.Bxc4 dxc4 
{the riskier choice, although Houdini evaluates it the same as ...Rxc4. With the
new pawn imbalance, Black hopes to use the passed c-pawn to her advantage while
containing White's central pawns.} 21.Ng4 Bg5 22.Qc3 {although the queen is not
normally an ideal blockading piece, here it remains well-placed, protecting e3
and occupying the long diagonal, which potentially could be useful after a d5
push.} 22...a6 {this seems unnecessary at this point, as White was not going to
make any more progress with the b-pawn.} ( 22...Qd6 23.Ne5 Rc7 24.a4 Qd5 {is one
possible alternative approach that does not allow White nearly as much latitude
as in the game.} ) 23.d5 h5 {entering a long tactical sequence.} 24.bxa6 Qxa6 
25.Qe5 hxg4 26.Qxg5 c3 27.Qe7 c2 28.Rbc1 exd5 ( 28...Qb6 $5 {and if} 29.Qxe6+ 
{then} 29...Qxe6 30.dxe6 Rxa2 31.e7 Re8 {is fine for Black.} ) 29.Qf7+ Kh7 ( 
29...Kh8 {gives Black an extra defensive resource in the form of the g-pawn.} 
30.Rf5 g6 ) 30.Rf5 {the threat is mate on h5.} 30...Rc6 31.Rxc2 $14 Rh6 32.Rg5 
Qf6 33.Qxf6 Rxf6 34.Rxg4 {the dust has settled and Black is disadvantaged in the
rook endgame, but not fatally so.} 34...Ra3 35.Rg3 Rc6 36.Rb2 Rg6 37.Rxg6 Kxg6 
38.Kf2 Kf5 39.Rxb7 Rxa2+ 40.Kf3 Kf6 41.Rd7 Rd2 42.h4 Rd1 43.g4 Rf1+ 44.Ke2 Rh1
