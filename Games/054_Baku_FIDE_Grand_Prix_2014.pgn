1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 {the Leningrad Dutch.} 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c3 
{White here probably wanted to avoid Nakamura's deep preparation against the
standard continuation of c4.} 6...d6 7.Qb3+ {the most popular idea as a
follow-up. White takes advantage of the diagonal being clear.} 7...e6 {this is
something of a concession to White, as Black would prefer to be able to play e5,
but on the positive side the move also reinforces d5, while e6 is no longer a
weak point.} 8.Bg5 {Ng5 is popular here, opening up the long diagonal for the
bishop, as well as the more prosaic Nbd2.} 8...Qe8 $146 {the usual idea behind
this move in the Leningrad is to support an advance of the e-pawn, as well as
give the queen a path to the kingside after g6 is vacated.} ( 8...Nc6 $5 
{scores the best for Black, albeit based on only a handful of games. The point
is that the pawn advance d5 is not possible at this stage, unlike in the main
line with a pawn on c4.} ) 9.Nbd2 Nh5 {Black decides to leave the queenside
undeveloped and start operations on the kingside immediately.} 10.Ne1 h6 11.Be3 
g5 {continuing to ignore the queenside, despite the threat to the b-pawn.} 
12.f4 {preempting the push of the f-pawn by Black.} ( 12.Bxb7 Bxb7 13.Qxb7 Nc6 
{is OK for Black, who is threatening to push with ...f4 (trapping the bishop) or
seize the b-file. For example} 14.f3 Rb8 15.Qa6 ( 15.Qxc7 $2 Rf7 16.Qxd6 Bf8 
{and the queen is trapped.} ) 15...f4 16.gxf4 gxf4 17.Bf2 Rxb2 $11 ) 12...gxf4 
13.Bxf4 Kh8 14.Be3 Nc6 15.Nd3 b6 {it's interesting to see Black take the time
now to secure the b-pawn, when he could continue pressing in the center.} ( 
15...e5 $5 {would force the issue.} 16.dxe5 dxe5 $11 ) 16.g4 {White can do a
variety of things here. This does not seem to be the most productive, however.} 
16...Nf6 {Black chooses to decline the sacrifice. Nakamura tends to be the one
who prefers having initiative or other compensation for material, rather than
the other way around.} ( 16...fxg4 17.Rxf8+ Bxf8 {is evaluated as equal by the
engine. White has some play for the pawn on the kingside and down the f-file.} 
) 17.gxf5 exf5 {while Black's pawn structure is shattered on the kingside, White
is no better. Black's pawn on f5 is also difficult to attack and he has
prospects on the g-file.} 18.Bf2 Be6 19.Qc2 Bd5 20.Nf3 Be4 {after this lengthy
bishop maneuver, Black has fully equalized and seems to have a clearer strategy
to follow on the kingside.} 21.Qd2 Ne7 {with the Be4 covering the diagonal, the
knight can now reposition itself without risk.} 22.Bh4 {White looks to exchange
his "bad" bishop for one of Black's good knights, but this also will remove a
key dark-square defender from the game.} 22...Ng6 23.Bxf6 Rxf6 24.Rf2 c5 {this
move highlights one of the interesting things about the Dutch, in that Black has
to look at playing on all portions of the board to be most effective, and not
just fixate on the kingside. Black now threatens to push ...c4 and would welcome
the open d-file if the pawn were exchanged.} 25.Raf1 Qe6 26.a3 Rg8 $17 {Black
can now build up pressure rather easily on the kingside and center (g- and
e-files) and he has firmly taken over the initiative.} 27.Kh1 Kh7 28.Qe3 {this
move highlights how White's pieces are awkwardly placed and not cooperating
well, as well as the lack of constructive plans available to White.} 28...Re8 
29.Qd2 Rg8 30.Qe3 {a repetition sequence that no doubt helped with the time
control.} 30...c4 31.Nf4 $6 {this allows Black to solve the problem of what to
do with the Ng6, as he now exchanges it off and places a much more effective
rook on the square.} ( 31.Nde1 $5 ) 31...Nxf4 32.Qxf4 Rg6 33.h3 {this does not
appear very helpful, but White is in serious difficulty anyway.} ( 33.Rg1 $5 ) 
33...Bf6 34.Kh2 Be7 35.Bh1 {evidently the point of the earlier maneuvers on the
h-file. Removing the bishop as a target does not rescue White from his
predicament, however.} 35...R8g7 {clearing the g8 square for the queen.} 36.Rg2 
Bg5 $1 {the key move and the result of excellent calculation by Black.} 37.Qg3 
( 37.Nxg5+ hxg5 $19 {and both the Qf4 and Rg2 are attacked, so White loses
material.} ) 37...Bc1 $19 {White is now embarrassed on the g-file.} 38.Rxc1 
{White cannot save the queen without giving a winning attack to Black. For
example} ( 38.Qf2 Bf4+ 39.Kg1 Bg3 40.Qe3 f4 41.Qc1 ( 41.Qd2 Qxh3 42.e3 Bh2+ ) 
41...Qxh3 $19 ) ( 38.Qh4 Rxg2+ 39.Bxg2 Qg6 40.Bh1 Be3 $19 {and White has no good
moves, with mating possibilities for Black looming.} ) 38...Rxg3 39.Rxg3 Bxf3 
{Black decides to simplify down into a won endgame.} ( 39...Rxg3 {might be a
more obvious way to do it for most Class players.} 40.Kxg3 f4+ 41.Kh2 Bf5 $19 ) 
40.Rxg7+ Kxg7 41.Bxf3 Qe3 42.Rg1+ Kf6 43.Bh5 Qd2 {White's series of checks
cannot harm the Black king and Black's queen in the end can simply pick off the
remaining pawns, so White then resigns.} 44.Rg6+ Ke7 45.Rg7+ Kd8 46.Rg8+ Kc7 
47.Rg7+ Kb8 48.Rg8+ Kb7 0-1
