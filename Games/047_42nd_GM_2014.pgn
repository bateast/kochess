1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 Bg4 {this modern move (in place of the formerly
standard deployment to f5) is an interesting alternative. The bishop is harder
to exchange off for White and of course pins the knight. However, the bishop is
missed on the h7-b1 diagonal, where it is strong (and one of the reasons why
White normally immediately spends extra time in the opening to exchange it
off).} 5.Qb3 {immediately taking advantage of the bishop's absence from the
queenside.} 5...Qb6 {the strongest response. Black does not care if he ends up
with doubled b-pawns after a queen exchange, with a half-open a-file and the
extra pawn on b6 influencing the c5 square.} 6.Nc3 {White continues his
development and focuses on the action at the d5 square, rather than worrying
about the potential exchange on f3.} 6...e6 {as does Black.} ( 6...Bxf3 {it
would seem useful to inflict doubled f-pawns on White and weaken the kingside
structure, but White gets dynamic compensation in the center and the half-open
g-file, as the following recent game illustrates.} 7.gxf3 e6 8.e4 Qxb3 9.axb3

CYP 2014} ) 7.Nh4 {White now turns to the kingside and drives the bishop away to
be exchanged, a common plan in master play.} 7...Be7 8.h3 {remarkably played 100
percent of the time in the database.} 8...Bh5 9.g4 Bg6 10.Nxg6 hxg6 11.Bg2 {the
logical follow-up for development.} 11...g5 {while this loosens Black's kingside
pawns, it is more important to fix White's h-pawn by controlling h4. Black
scores 50 percent from this position and appears to be fully equal.} 12.Bd2 
Nbd7 13.Qa4 Qc7 {moving the queen to a better diagonal and anticipating a
possible c5 advance. The b2 pawn is en prise, but tactically protected (after
Rb1).} 14.cxd5 Nxd5 {choosing to emphasize piece play slightly more with this
recapture, rather than doing it with the e-pawn.} ( 14...cxd5 {would simply give
White an easier game and more open lines on the queenside.} 15.Rc1 Qd8 ) 15.O-O 
O-O 16.Rac1 Rad8 {the a-pawn is tactically protected for Black, similar to how
the b-pawn was for White earlier on.} 17.Qc2 Qb8 18.Rfd1 Rfe8 {Black's maneuvers
seem rather slow, but White does not seem to have any way to take advantage of
that.} 19.Ne2 Nf8 20.a3 {a prophylactic move in order to take the b4 square away
from Black's pieces.} 20...Ng6 21.b4 Nh4 {the point of Black's (slow) plan.} 
22.Qb3 e5 {of course Black could also exchange on g2 prior to playing the pawn
advance. The idea is to exchange the d-pawn and weaken White's center.} 23.Bh1 
a6 24.a4 ( 24.Nc3 $5 {the point being that now if} 24...exd4 ( 24...Nxc3 {is
better but after} 25.Bxc3 exd4 26.Bxd4 Bd6 {White has a more comfortable game.} 
) 25.Nxd5 cxd5 26.Bxd5 $14 ) 24...exd4 25.Nxd4 Nf4 {a nice tactically-enabled
maneuver that forces the indirect exchange of the knights and gives Black the
initiative.} 26.exf4 Rxd4 27.fxg5 Red8 28.Be3 Rxb4 {Black now has the advantage
of a 3-1 queenside majority, but the position is also more open for White's
bishops and Black's Nh4 is mostly out of play.} 29.Qc2 Qe5 {a strong
centralizing move that gets the queen in the game and also pressures the g5
pawn.} 30.Rxd8+ Bxd8 31.Rb1 a5 {this move gives White a chance to avoid the
threat to the h-pawn from a penetrating Black queen, but White either failed to
recognize this or decided that he did not like how the variation would turn
out.} ( 31...Rxb1+ 32.Qxb1 Bc7 33.Kf1 Qh2 34.Ke2 Qxh3 $17 ) 32.Bd2 ( 32.Rxb4 
axb4 33.Qe4 Qa1+ 34.Kh2 Bc7+ 35.Bf4 Bxf4+ 36.Qxf4 {Black's queenside majority
looks quite threatening here, but White's active, centralized queen helps
compensate, especially with Black's king being open to harassment and White
being able to bring the bishop into play via e4.} ) 32...Bc7 {a threat for a
threat. Black's threat to the king is the most urgent, so White is forced to
address it first.} 33.Kf1 Qh2 34.Ke2 Qe5+ 35.Kf1 Qh2 36.Ke2 {a repetition of the
sequence which White is perfectly happy with. Black probably did not mind
getting close to making time control either.} 36...Rxb1 37.Qxb1 Qxh3 38.Qe4 Ng6 
{Black must activate his knight in order to have any chance of realizing his
advantage.} 39.Qe8+ {as noted in the above variation, White's queen is well
positioned to harass Black's king and its activity partially compensates for
Black's material advantage.} 39...Nf8 40.Bf3 Qh2 41.Be3 Qe5 {by exchanging,
Black benefits by getting rid of his queen's more active counterpart and
allowing the Nf8 to get moving again. However, White's two bishops now come more
fully into their own.} 42.Qxe5 Bxe5 43.Be4 Ne6 44.g6 Bf4 45.Bb6 {of course White
is not interested in breaking up his bishop pair.} 45...Bc7 46.Be3 Kf8 {Black
could of course repeat moves, but he is still trying to find some way to make
progress.} 47.Kd3 {White now mobilizes his king and heads it for the most
crucial sector of the board, to pit it against Black's pawns.} 47...Ke7 ( 
47...fxg6 $5 48.Bxg6 Nf4+ 49.Bxf4 Bxf4 {would get rid of White's bishop pair but
end up with opposite-colored bishops. Black evidently felt this was too drawish,
but the game continuation ends up offering nothing better.} ) 48.Kc4 fxg6 
49.Bxg6 Kf6 50.Bf5 g6 51.Bxe6 {preserving the bishop would seem better, but
White decides to rely on the opposite-colored bishop dynamic and his kingside
pawn majority to offset Black's pawn and achieve a draw.} 51...Kxe6 52.f4 Bb8 
{both sides now indulge in bishop maneuvers and Black shuffles his king between
e6 and f7, to restrain White's pawn majority. Black decides not to potentially
overpress his advantage and the game ends peacefully.} 53.Bd2 Bc7 54.Be3 Bd6 
55.Bd2 Kf7 56.Be3 Bb4 57.Bc1 Ke6 58.Be3 Kf7 59.Bc1 Ke6 60.Be3 Kf7 1/2-1/2
