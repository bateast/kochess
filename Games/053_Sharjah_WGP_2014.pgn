and is the most popular in the database. One recent game:} 9...a6 10.d4 b5

10...Nxd5 $5 ) 11.Nb5 {with the pawn on c6 now gone, the nimble knight can
activate itself and target Black's dark-square bishop.} 11...Nf8 ( 11...Bb8 
{would preserve the bishop, which has to cover the c7 square to prevent a knight
fork. This looks a little awkward, but appears best strategically.} ) 12.Rc1 
$14 {deploying the rook usefully and sealing the fate of Black's bishop, which
must now suffer being exchanged.} 12...a6 ( 12...Bb8 {no longer would preserve
the bishop, as it would have to exchange itself for the knight after Nc7.} ) 
13.Nxd6 Qxd6 14.O-O $16 {Komodo 8 already gives a significant positional plus to
White, who dominates the only open file and has the two bishops. Black's forces
meanwhile are uncoordinated.} 14...N6d7 15.Qc7 Qe7 {Black evidently assesses
that the exchange of queens would lessen her practical chances for counterplay.} 
( 15...Qxc7 16.Rxc7 Ne6 17.Rc2 f6 18.Rfc1 $16 ) 16.Rc2 ( 16.Qa5 $5 {is an
interesting alternative.} 16...Qd6 17.Ba3 Qg6 18.Kh1 Qe6 19.Rc7 ) ( 16.Nxe5 $2 
{would be a tactical blunder.} 16...Nxe5 17.Qxe7 Rxe7 ) 16...Ne6 17.Qa5 e4 
18.Nd4 {White's knight is happy to go to such an excellent central outpost. If
Ne6 exchanges it, White can then penetrate on c7.} 18...Qg5 {Black protects the
d-pawn, but White is going to have a free hand on the queenside.} ( 18...Nxd4 
19.Bxd4 Ne5 20.Qxd5 Nc6 21.Bc5 $16 ) 19.Nxe6 Rxe6 20.Rfc1 {a preparatory move
that is a more conservative way to maintain the advantage.} ( 20.f4 $5 
{immediately is suggested by the engine. This kicks the queen and picks up the
d5 pawn, or otherwise leads to more problems for Black.} 20...Qh4 ( 20...b6 
21.fxg5 bxa5 22.Rc7 $18 ) ( 20...exf3 21.Bxf3 $18 {White is going to win the
d-pawn in this line as well, as she has the back-rank threat of playing Qd8 if
the Qg5 is deflected. For example} 21...b5 $2 22.Bxd5 ) 21.Qxd5 $18 ) 20...Re8 
{protects against possible back-rank threats, such as those shown in the
previous variation.} 21.f4 exf3 22.Bxf3 b5 {defending the d-pawn by interference
with the Qa5.} 23.Qc7 Nf8 24.h4 {a masterly move that again threatens to deflect
the queen from protection of d5.} 24...Qf5 ( 24...Qxh4 25.Bxd5 Be6 26.Bxa8 Rxa8 
$18 ) 25.Qg3 {targeting the g-pawn and causing another weakness in Black's
structure.} 25...g6 {this turns out to severely weaken Black's defense.} ( 
25...f6 ) 26.Rc5 Bb7 27.Rc7 Bc8 ( 27...Rab8 28.Bg4 Qe4 29.Qf2 $18 ) 28.R7c5 
{repetition here was probably for time management purposes, bringing the time
control closer for free.} 28...Bb7 29.e4 {White continues pressing against the
d5 pawn. She will never actually capture it, but all of her threats cause her
opponent to lose ground in responding to them.} 29...Rxe4 {Black decides in
desperation to sacrifice the exchange in order to try to relieve the pressure.} 
( 29...Qe6 30.Bg4 Qxe4 31.Rc7 $18 ) 30.Bxe4 Qxe4 31.Re1 {note how the Qg3
assists rook placement on both e1 and c7.} 31...Qf5 32.Rc7 Bc8 33.Qc3 {now
Black's kingside holes become the decisive factor.} 33...f6 34.Qxf6 {White now
has a number of ways to win and picks a safe and easy one.} 34...Qxf6 35.Bxf6 
Nd7 36.Bd4 Kf8 37.Rec1 {the Bc8 is lost and with it, the game.} 1-0
