1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.Bc4 {a sideline that has been
popular in the past, for example used in the Tal-Botvinnik matches, where its
theory evolved considerably. White targets f7 and plans to follow up with
N1e2-f4, eyeing tactics on e6.} 6...e6 7.N1e2 Bd6 {Black's response in this
variation to White's strategic plan is simple: exchange off the knight if it
goes to f4.} 8.h4 h6 9.Nf4 Bxf4 10.Bxf4 Nf6 11.h5 {in line with Spassky's
"modern" method of how to use the h-pawn in main line Caro-Kann. Here's an
alternate take from the 1960 Tal-Botvinnik World Championship match:} ( 11.Qd2

) 11...Bh7 12.O-O O-O 13.Bd3 $146 {in comparison with the main line, White now
takes an extra tempo to exchange off the Bh7. This is a reasonable trade in
strategic terms, as Black's bishop occupies an excellent diagonal and its White
counterpart is hemmed in by Black's pawn structure. Although this is one of
Houdini's top choices, according to the database it is a novelty. Presumably
White players are normally looking for something more ambitious in this
variation.} 13...Bxd3 14.Qxd3 Nbd7 {we now have a standard-looking Caro-Kann
structure from the main line, the difference being that White has bishop for
knight. While this may provide a slight edge, it is worth noting that White's
knights can be effective attackers in the main line, especially when targeting
e6/f7, which is not possible here due to the absence of both the light-square
bishop and a suitably placed knight.} 15.Rfd1 Re8 16.c4 Qa5 {the idea being to
restrain b4 and develop the queen to a more useful square. Also worth noting is
how the queen exerts lateral force along the fifth rank, especially against the
h-pawn, although Black is not able to make anything of it during the game.} 
17.a3 Rac8 18.b4 Qa4 {Black takes advantage of the lack of a light-square bishop
to occupy the hole on a4.} 19.Qf3 ( 19.Ne4 $5 {threatening to occupy d6} 
19...Nxe4 20.Qxe4 a5 {is still all right for Black, but White would thereby
accentuate the B v N dynamic.} ) 19...a5 20.Bd2 ( 20.bxa5 Qxc4 ) 20...axb4 
21.axb4 Qc2 {Black logically continues her campaign of penetrating White's
queenside with her queen.} 22.Rac1 Qa2 23.Qc3 Qa8 {Black now opts to continue
maneuvering with her queen, rather than changing the position's structure.} ( 
23...b5 {would be a little more ambitious, although still generally equal.} 
24.cxb5 ( 24.Rc2 Qxc4 25.Qxc4 bxc4 26.Rxc4 Nb6 27.Rc5 Nbd5 ) ( 24.Qd3 bxc4 
25.Rxc4 Red8 {now the c-pawn is protected tactically, for example} 26.Rdc1 $2 ( 
26.Rc2 Qd5 27.Rdc1 Rb8 ) 26...Ne5 ) 24...cxb5 25.Qxc8 Rxc8 26.Rxc8+ Kh7 {would
produce a situation where the queen should be a little better than the two
rooks, for example.} ) 24.Ra1 Qb8 25.Qc1 Qd6 26.Bf4 Qe7 {there is no rush to
capture on b4, as Black cannot hold the pawn.} 27.Re1 Qxb4 28.Rb1 Qa5 {the
probable continuation would be 29. c5 Ra8 30. Rxb7 Ra7 followed by a rook
exchange, which appeared sufficiently drawish for the two players to call it a
day.} 1/2-1/2
