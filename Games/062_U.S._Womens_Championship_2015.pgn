1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 {this move has little independent value, as Black almost
always takes on e4 in response. However, an alternative is ...g6 followed by
...Bg7, in which case White will follow with c3, blunting the pressure on the
long diagonal.} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 {the Classical Caro-Kann.} 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.Nh3 
{an unusual choice. The knight normally goes to f3 and the development N1e2 used
to be another popular significant option. The text move is obviously offbeat,
but it scores well (58 percent) and has been used in some recent high-level
games.} 6...Nf6 7.Bc4 ( 7.Nf4 {would transpose to the N1e2 lines.} ) 7...e6 
8.O-O Be7 ( 8...Bd6 {is often used in the N1e2-f4 lines to fight for the f4
square and is the normal choice here as well. The text move indicates that Black
in this game may have had a greater concern for the h4-d8 diagonal and the g5
square. Here's a recent game that parallels White's plan in the main game, using
the f4 advance:} 9.f4 Qc7 10.Kh1 O-O 11.f5 exf5 12.Nxf5 Nbd7 13.Nxd6 Qxd6 
14.Bf4 Qb4 15.Bb3 a5 16.c3 Qb6 17.Bd6 Rfe8 18.Nf4 Be4 19.Nh5 Bg6 20.Nf4 Be4 
21.Nh5 Bg6 22.Nf4 Be4 {1/2-1/2 (22) Rozentalis,E (2604)-Prohaszka,P (2599)
Austria 2015} ) 9.f4 {now out of the database, although more because of Black's
unusual bishop move. The text move is also usually played in response to ... Bd6
(as shown in the game quoted above). The f-pawn advance is a logical follow-up
to Nh3 as an independent line, as White takes advantage of the f4 square being
open (i.e. not occupied by a knight). It also influences g5 and e5 to White's
advantage.} ( 9.Nf4 {is usually where the knight goes.} ) 9...Qd7 {this doesn't
appear to be a bad move and reinforces f5. However, it blocks the Nb8's
development temporarily and the f-pawn's advance is not to be feared.} ( 
9...O-O 10.f5 exf5 11.Nxf5 Bxf5 12.Rxf5 c5 $11 ) 10.Kh1 {this gets the king off
the now-weak g1-a7 diagonal and removes future potential tactics involving
exchanges on d4 or c5. However, it's also a bit slow and should allow Black to
fully equalize.} ( 10.Be3 {played immediately should save a tempo and cover the
diagonal.} ) 10...O-O ( 10...c5 $5 {whenever Black can get this pawn break in
effectively without king safety issues, it's normally a good idea. White doesn't
appear to have anything useful to do in response. For example, the engine can
only come up with} 11.f5 exf5 12.dxc5 Qxd1 13.Rxd1 O-O $11 ) 11.Be3 {this
reinforces d4 and helps restrain ...c5. However, now that the king is off the
diagonal, it's not the most effective use of White's time.} ( 11.Ng5 {would seem
more to the point here, again logically following up on the presence of the Nh3.
Otherwise the knight is effectively doing nothing. Chasing it away with} 
11...h6 $6 {would simply waste a tempo helping the knight to a better square,
from where it could then go to e5 (a much better square).} ) 11...c5 {White is
now better positioned to combat this pawn break.} ( 11...Na6 {gets the knight
into the game and White has nothing better than to exchange it. This shatters
the queenside pawn structure, but in Black's favor are the two bishops and a
semi-open b-file.} 12.Bxa6 bxa6 $15 {Komodo 8 gives Black a small plus here.
Black's pieces are, in addition to the above points, better coordinated.} ) 
12.f5 {White chooses to try for some action on the kingside rather than trade in
the center, which would lead to a more simplified position:} ( 12.dxc5 Qxd1 
13.Raxd1 Bxc2 14.Rc1 $11 {although the engine rates this position as equal,
White seems to have the easier position to play, at least for the short term.} 
) 12...Bxf5 ( 12...exf5 13.dxc5 Qc8 {would preserve the Bg6, unlike the text
move. Although the bishop is more of a "big pawn", it does well as a defensive
piece on the kingside and is certainly no worse than the Nh3.} 14.b4 ( 14.Nf4 
Bxc5 $15 ) 14...Rd8 15.Qe2 Nc6 $11 ) 13.Nxf5 exf5 14.dxc5 Ng4 {Black at this
point has achieved equality and just needs to complete her development. The text
move is a nice way for Black to threaten the bishop and occupy a rare advanced
outpost on the kingside.} 15.Bg1 g6 {Black should not be afraid to enter into
this type of pawn structure when necessary, in this case to protect the advanced
f-pawn. The dark square weakness can be covered by the bishop, while White's
bishop is in no position to exploit it.} 16.Bd5 $6 {this looks overly
aggressive. White needs to be careful about the weak c-pawn, which is easily
attacked again, and also needs to bring the Nh3 into the game.} ( 16.b4 a5 
17.c3 $11 ) 16...Qc7 17.b4 {the difference with the earlier variation is that
the Qc7 is now pressuring c5 already. Also note the threat to h2 from the knight
and queen, which means the Bg1 cannot currently move without allowing a mate.} 
17...Nc6 {Black finally has all her minor pieces developed, and to effective
squares. The queen's rook will also go to a nice square on d8.} ( 17...a5 $5 
{would more directly attack the exposed queenside.} 18.c3 axb4 19.cxb4 Bf6 
20.Rb1 Nc6 {and Black now has the initiative, for example} 21.Qb3 Bd4 $15 ) 
18.Rb1 Rad8 19.c4 b6 {Black has a number of reasonable choices here.} ( 
19...Bf6 {preparing ...Be5 would redeploy the bishop effectively.} ) 20.Nf4 
{White wastes no more time in getting her knight back into the game.} 20...bxc5 
21.bxc5 {The doubled c-pawns may be a long-term weakness, but they're also
passed pawns. White's pieces are also now working together much better.} 
21...Rb8 $6 {Black may have done this just on general principles, without
looking at the tactics fully. If she could recapture on b8 with the rook, that
would certainly help her position. Unfortunately it doesn't work out that way.} 
( 21...Bg5 $5 ) ( 21...Rc8 $5 {would free the d8 square for the other rook and
also line up on the weak pawns.} ) 22.Rxb8 Nxb8 {ugly, but better than the
alternative.} ( 22...Rxb8 {the main problem with this is that now when the White
bishop goes to h2, it has targets on both c7 and b8.} 23.h3 Nge5 ( 23...Nf6 
24.Bh2 Qd7 25.Bxc6 Qxc6 26.Nxg6 hxg6 27.Bxb8 $16 ) 24.Bh2 Bf6 25.Nd3 Re8 26.Qa4 
$16 ) 23.h3 $14 Ne5 24.Re1 {White brings her rook to a more effective file and
generates additional potential tactical problems for Black, now that the e-file
is under pressure. The Qc7 is a bit overloaded, as it cannot protect the Ne5 and
support an exchange on c5 at the same time.} 24...Bh4 {Black's best option,
getting the bishop off the e-file and gaining a tempo with the attack on the
Re1.} 25.Re2 Nbc6 26.Bxc6 {this dissipates some of White's pressure. The knight
will now also get off the e-file.} ( 26.Bh2 $16 {still looks very effective.} ) 
26...Nxc6 27.Qd6 Qc8 {Black naturally does not exchange on d6, which would
create two monster passed pawns for White.} 28.Nd5 {this position is probably
what White was looking at when she decided to exchange on c6. She still has an
edge, but with fewer pieces on the board there are less attacking chances.} 
28...Re8 29.Rxe8+ Qxe8 {with the additional exchange, Black probably was looking
to head into an endgame with a small disadvantage, but with good drawing
chances. The c-pawns look like they can be blockaded effectively.} 30.Nc7 $6 
{the idea behind this move is not clear to me. In the game, it results in
Black's queen moving to a much more effective centralized position, without
generating any evident threats.} ( 30.Bf2 {would be a clever tactical way to
improve White's position and get the Black bishop off the h4-e1 diagonal. The
bishop has to protect f6 due to the fork threat from the Nd5.} ) 30...Qe4 $11 
31.Qd5 Bg3 {the bishop is now free to move and attacks the Nc7 "backwards" along
the diagonal.} 32.Nb5 Qe1 {with the threat of ...Bf2} 33.Nd6 $2 {White chooses
to counterattack with a threat to f7, but she runs out of threats first, losing
the game.} ( 33.Nd4 {is the necessary defensive move.} 33...Nxd4 34.Qxd4 $11 ) 
33...Ne5 $1 {holds everything together for Black.} 34.Qa8+ {this starts a long
sequence where Black's king is chased almost the entire length of the board, but
eventually finds refuge.} ( 34.Nxf5 gxf5 35.Qd8+ Kg7 36.Qg5+ Ng6 $19 {is the
best try for White, but still leaves Black winning. For example} 37.Qxf5 Be5 
38.Qf2 Qc1 39.c6 Qxc4 {and Black's material advantage is decisive.} ) 34...Kg7 
35.Ne8+ Kh6 36.Nf6 Bf2 {Black had to calculate everything precisely to proceed
with this move, but saw correctly that White would not be able to deliver mate
or get a perpetual check.} 37.Qf8+ Kg5 38.Nxh7+ Kf4 39.Qh6+ Ke4 40.Ng5+ Kd3 
{White has run out of moves and mate on g1 is coming.} 0-1
