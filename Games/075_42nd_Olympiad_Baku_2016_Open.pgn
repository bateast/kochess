1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 {it's been noted by commentators that Kramnik in 2016
often largely avoided theoretical duels in the opening, in favor of simple flank
opening development early on. This parallels Carlsen's similar practice of often
"just playing chess", a strategy that succeeds when your overall level of
understanding and effort is better than your opponent's.} 3...Bf5 4.O-O c6 
{Black is using a Slav-type structure, which is solid if unambitious.} 5.d3 e6 
6.Nh4 {a standard maneuver against a Slav bishop developed to f5.} 6...Bg4 7.h3 
Bh5 8.Qe1 {removing the queen from the line of the pin and supporting the idea
of an e-pawn advance.} 8...Be7 9.f4 Nfd7 {pressuring the Nh4, among other things
so that it cannot support f4-f5.} 10.Nf3 {White's last two moves have now given
him a mainline Leningrad Dutch (!) structure in reverse. Kramnik knows these
structures well.} 10...f5 {presumably aimed at deterring the thematic Leningrad
Dutch e-pawn advance, but...} 11.e4 {anyway!} 11...Bxf3 {an understandable
decision to exchange minor pieces, as the bishop is currently largely locked out
of the game by its own pawns on the light squares.} 12.Bxf3 {nevertheless, the
exchange seems to leave White in a good position on the kingside, with his own
bishop now improved.} 12...O-O 13.Nc3 {White at this point has a clean structure
with his pieces working relatively well together. Black now has a Stonewall pawn
structure, but his pieces are not as well placed or developed.} 13...fxe4 
14.dxe4 d4 {this seems overly ambitious. Black completely gives up his solid
central pawn wedge in a forward thrust for space. It certianly inconveniences
White temporarily, but in the longer term it weakens Black's game.} 15.Nd1 e5 
16.Nf2 {Kramnik has plenty of time to usefully reposition the knight, as Black
has to take additional time to shore up his advanced d4 pawn and get his pieces
out.} 16...c5 17.Qe2 {putting the queen on more useful diagonals and clearing
the back rank to connect the rooks.} 17...Nc6 18.Bg4 {a beautiful place for the
bishop. Now the downside of Black's earlier decisions - to exchange off his
light-square bishop and advance the pawn wedge - is highlighted.} 18...Kh8 
19.Be6 exf4 {done in order to inconvenience and disrupt White's kingside.} 
20.gxf4 {here Komodo assesses the position as completely level, although it
seems easier to play as White. Adhiban makes a rather drastic decision to try to
further disrupt White's structure, but this time the weaknesses he leaves behind
after the g-pawn advance become more acute.} 20...g5 $6 ( {After something like} 
20...Qc7 21.Nd3 {White has an equal but pleasant game, with ideas like f4-f5,
Kh1 followed by Rg1, etc.} ) 21.Ng4 {the knight hops to a strong square, with
multiple benefits (blocking the g-file, eyeing h6 and f6 as well as e5).} ( 
21.f5 {also looks good here.} ) 21...gxf4 22.Bxf4 $16 {White's two bishops are
looking really good now.} 22...Qe8 {shifting diagonals with the idea of
redeploying to g6.} 23.e5 $5 {this is a key moment and White has multiple ways
to proceed. Kramnik picks a world-class and complex way, by offering the Ng4.} 
23...Bh4 ( 23...h5 {is the critical way to oppose White's idea, by threatening
the Ng4.} 24.Kh1 ( 24.Nh6 $2 {is one option and something many Class players
would first consider, since it looks aggressive.} 24...Qg6+ {is the big problem
with it.} 25.Kh1 d3 ( 25...Qxe6 $2 26.Qxh5 $1 {leads to mate and would justify
White's aggressive play.} ) 26.Qg2 ( 26.cxd3 $2 Nd4 {and Black wins due to the
hanging Be6.} ) 26...Qxe6 27.Rg1 Rg8 28.Nxg8 Rxg8 $17 ) 24...d3 ( 24...hxg4 $2 
{loses to} 25.Qxg4 {with a completely open field in front of Black's king,
versus White's queen, two bishops and rook.} ) 25.Qg2 Nd4 {a similar idea as in
the above variation, but now the queen is on g2, so White can play} 26.Bd5 $16 
{with heavy kingside pressure.} ) 24.Bc4 {withdrawing the bishop after the
discovered attack, but its effectiveness is not lessened any, plus e5-e6 is now
a possibility. White's space advantage and mobility gives him a significant
plus.} 24...Qg6 25.Kh1 {avoiding the ...h5 threat, now that the Qg6 is present.} 
25...Bg5 {naturally Black seeks to exchange off one of White's two bishops, but
to no avail.} 26.Bh2 {again, the bishop retreat shows no loss of effectiveness
for the piece, plus the f-file is uncovered.} 26...Nb6 ( 26...Rxf1+ {would be an
attempt to exchange off material and reduce White's threats, but after} 27.Rxf1 
Rf8 28.Rxf8+ Nxf8 29.e6 $1 $18 {the advanced passed e-pawn gives White the
advantage.} ) 27.Bd3 $18 {moving the bishop to an even better diagonal.} 
27...Qe6 28.Qe4 {sometimes the obvious threats (in this case mate on h7) are
still best.} 28...Qd5 29.e6 $1 {passed pawns must be pushed! White now would be
fine with a queen exchange.} 29...Rae8 30.Rxf8+ {now reducing material favors
White's positional advantages, with the pawn sitting on e6.} 30...Rxf8 31.Ne5 ( 
31.Rg1 {is favored by the engines as an enhanced version of the idea behind the
text move.} 31...Qxe4+ 32.Bxe4 Kg7 33.Ne5 $18 ) 31...Qxe4+ 32.Bxe4 Nd8 33.a4 
{an interesting idea and not one Class players would consider, given that it
surrenders the e-pawn.} ( 33.Nd7 {has been noted as a more direct route to
victory.} 33...Nxd7 34.exd7 Kg7 ( 34...Rf7 35.Be5+ Bf6 36.Bd5 $1 $18 ) 35.Rg1 
Kh6 {and now White can win with either Bd5, controlling key squares, or going
for material with Bxh7. It is still complicated, however.} ) 33...Nxe6 34.a5 
{the point of the idea, chasing the knight away from defending the d7 square
while the b-pawn is hanging and cannot be protected.} 34...Nc8 35.Nd7 {Kramnik
by this point evidently saw a path to a win and was comfortable following it,
without necessarily seizing every available opportunity.} ( 35.Bd5 $5 Nf4 
36.Nf7+ Kg7 37.Nxg5 Nxd5 38.Ne6+ Kf7 39.Nxf8 $16 ) 35...Re8 $2 {not the best
defense. It looks obvious, lining up against the hanging Be4, but White now uses
the available tempo-gaining check to dominate Black's side of the board.} ( 
35...Rd8 36.Bxb7 ( 36.Be5+ {as in the game continuation is also a strong idea.} 
) 36...Ne7 37.Ne5 $16 {with the two bishops so powerful and Black's weaker pawn
structure, Kramnik must have felt he could bring the point home with best
defense here.} ) 36.Be5+ Ng7 ( 36...Kg8 37.Bd5 b6 38.Rf1 $18 {and Black loses
material.} ) 37.Rg1 ( 37.Rf1 $5 ) 37...Bh6 38.Bxb7 $18 {at this point White has
achieved total dominance and can leisurely go about winning. Black has too many
weaknesses, for example at h7 and c5, while White's three advanced minor pieces
combine very effectively against them and the rook.} 38...Ne7 39.Nf6 Rf8 40.Be4 
Ng8 41.Nxh7 Re8 42.Ng5 {tactically defending the Be5 with the threatened fork
(and mate) on f7.} 42...Re7 43.Bd3 Bxg5 44.Rxg5 {threatening mate on h5 now,
given the pinned Ng7.} 44...Nh6 45.Bxg7+ {a simple, clean finish.} 45...Rxg7 
46.Rh5 1-0
