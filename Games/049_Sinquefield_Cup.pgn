1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nbd2 {for some reason this is a "hot" line, as shown
by the database, with a number of professional-level players using it in 2014 to
good effect. It's hard to imagine this being an objectively strong threat to the
Slav, however.} 4...Bf5 {standard and best.} 5.Nh4 {the overwhelming choice
lately for White, although the calmer g3 enjoys slightly more popularity
historically. Here is a recent high-level example:} ( 5.g3 e6 6.Bg2 h6 7.Ne5

Stockholm SWE 2014} ) 5...Be4 {provoking White's next. Also, since the bishop
will inevitably be traded for a knight, Black would have no problem doing this
on e4 instead of g6.} 6.f3 Bg6 7.e3 e6 8.g3 {this doesn't seem natural. The
engine makes it a top choice, however White never seems to follow up on the
idea.} ( 8.Nxg6 {is the obvious move, but all four database games with this line
are White losses, which undoubtedly was noted by Nakamura during his
preparation.} ) 8...Be7 9.a3 Nbd7 {Black continues developing naturally and
unhurriedly.} 10.cxd5 cxd5 {Black chooses to keep the overall pawn structure as
equal (5 and 2). Otherwise, White's kingside majority looks like it might be the
source of potential attacking pressure, even if not decisive.} 11.Nxg6 {White
finally finishes off the knight maneuver.} 11...hxg6 12.Bd3 e5 {Black chooses an
aggressive posture in the center, knowing that his lead in development (three
pieces to two) and better structure would benefit from its opening.} 13.O-O O-O 
14.Qb3 Qc8 $5 {this appears to be an attempt to avoid a possible drawing line.
Placement on the c8-h3 diagonal is also advantageous for Black.} ( 14...Bd6 {or
similar moves would try to bait White into taking the b-pawn, with a draw a
likely result. For example:} 15.Qxb7 Rb8 16.Qxa7 exd4 17.exd4 Ra8 18.Qb7 Qe7 
19.Kg2 Rfb8 {with a draw by repetition coming, as the queen cannot flee to
safety but cannot be cornered either.} ) ( 14...a6 15.Qxb7 exd4 16.exd4 Bc5 
17.dxc5 Nxc5 18.Qb4 Nxd3 {is another interesting variation on this theme.} ) 
15.Nb1 {Houdini agrees this is the best move, in order to reposition the knight
to c3, but this also points up the deficiency of developing the knight to d2 in
the first place.} 15...exd4 16.exd4 Nb8 {with the central pawn structure now
resolved, Black decides his knight is also better off repositioned, to pressure
d4.} 17.Nc3 Nc6 18.Be3 ( 18.Nxd5 Nxd5 19.Qxd5 Nxd4 $11 {; White cannot capture
on d4 due to the bishop skewer on c5.} ) 18...Qd7 19.Rad1 Rfd8 {overprotecting
d5.} 20.Rfe1 Ne8 {Caruana is now able to reposition his other knight in an
interesting maneuver, one that allows his bishop to spring to life.} 21.Bf2 Nc7 
22.Bf1 ( 22.Qxb7 $2 Rdb8 $19 ) 22...Bf6 {after the bishop maneuver, it appears
that White will have more long-term trouble with pressure against his d-pawn
than Black.} 23.Qa2 {moving the queen out of the way of the b-pawn. White is
looking to generate some activity on the queenside, with few prospects in the
center or on the kingside.} 23...g5 {this move often features in Black's plans
in this type of position, as the advanced g-pawn is in fact not that weak and
can usefully gain space. Here Caruana's idea is also to clear the 8th rank by
subsequently fianchettoing the king.} ( 23...Rab8 {is a more prosaic
alternative, preparing to push ...b5} ) 24.b4 g6 25.Qd2 {getting the queen out
of the corner to a more useful square.} 25...Kg7 26.b5 Ne7 ( 26...Na5 {is also
possible. For example} 27.Nxd5 Qxd5 28.Qxa5 Ne6 29.Qd2 Nxd4 30.Bxd4 Bxd4+ 
31.Kg2 $11 ) 27.Be3 Ne6 28.Bh3 Nf5 {with Black's knights getting ever more
active, White decides to exchange bishop for knight.} 29.Bxf5 gxf5 30.f4 {the
kingside pawn structure is now defined by Black, who prefers to close it.} ( 
30.Ne2 Qxb5 31.Qc2 $1 {with about equal position} ) 30...g4 31.Qd3 Rac8 {Black
has the easier game and it's hard to find something productive for White.} 
32.Rc1 ( 32.Qxf5 $2 {doesn't work.} 32...Nxd4 33.Qxd7 Nf3+ 34.Kf2 Rxd7 {and
Black wins material.} ) 32...Rc4 $15 {Black's pressure is making things very
uncomfortable for White, who has to cover both d4 and b5.} 33.Ne2 Nc7 {Caruana
shifts the knight again, making maximum use of his minor pieces.} 34.Nc3 {the
engine now shows White at a significant disadvantage.} ( 34.Rxc4 {would lead to
a rook endgame with Black a pawn up.} 34...dxc4 35.Qxc4 Nxb5 36.a4 Nxd4 37.Nxd4 
Bxd4 38.Bxd4+ Qxd4+ 39.Qxd4+ Rxd4 ) ( 34.b6 {Houdini suggests jettisoning the
pawn in order to inflict structural damage on Black's queenside.} 34...axb6 
35.Rxc4 dxc4 36.Qxc4 Ra8 37.Qd3 Nd5 ) 34...Rc8 ( 34...Nxb5 35.Nxb5 Qxb5 36.Qxf5 
Qd7 {is not as good for Black.} ) 35.h3 {perhaps Nakamura thought he was already
lost here and tried to generate counterplay in desperation.} ( 35.a4 {would hold
things together temporarily, but Black can reposition his pieces again to
further increase the pressure and achieve an advantage. For example} 35...Ne8 
36.Re2 Nd6 37.Rec2 Qe6 38.Bf2 Rb4 39.Qd2 Rcc4 $19 ) 35...gxh3 36.Kh2 Nxb5 
37.Nxb5 Qxb5 38.Kxh3 ( 38.Qxf5 $2 Qb2+ {with mate to follow.} ) 38...Qd7 $19 
{Black is now a clear pawn ahead, with a 2-1 queenside majority and far superior
piece placement.} 39.Kg2 b5 40.Rb1 a6 41.Rbc1 Qe6 42.Bf2 Rxc1 {Black is happy to
take two rooks for the queen.} 43.Rxe6 fxe6 44.g4 {Nakamura probably had this in
mind when playing 35. g3. White seeks to open lines on the kingside for his
queen. His bishop is the wrong color, though, for this to be effective.} 
44...fxg4 {this is enough to maintain the endgame advantage, although a tactical
option would have won quickly.} ( 44...Bh4 {is a non-obvious sacrifice. It works
by making White's queen vulnerable, since his king, without the Bf2 for
protection, can then be skewered.} 45.Bxh4 ( 45.Qe3 R8c2 ) 45...R8c3 46.Qe2 
R1c2 ) 45.Qe2 Kf7 46.Qd3 {Black's g-pawn is tactically protected, given the rook
skewer at g8.} 46...R1c2 47.Qh7+ Ke8 48.f5 $2 {aggressive but losing.} ( 48.Kf1 
) 48...Bxd4 $1 {Black of course had to calculate the next sequence carefully.} 
49.Qg6+ Kd8 50.Qxe6 Rxf2+ 51.Kg3 Rc3+ 52.Kxg4 Rg2+ 53.Kf4 Rf2+ 54.Kg4 Kc7 
55.Qe7+ Kb6 56.Qd8+ Rc7 {by this point Black has marched his king into a safe
zone, where White cannot further sustain any attacks.} 57.Qxd5 Bc5 58.Qd8 Kb7 
59.f6 Bxa3 60.Qd5+ Kb6 61.Qd8 Bc5 {with the bishop and rook covering the f8
queening square, and Black's other rook dominating the back ranks, the game is
hopeless for White.} 62.Qb8+ Rb7 63.Qd8+ Ka7 64.Qd5 Bb6 65.Kg5 Rc7 66.Kg6 b4 
67.Qe6 Bd4 0-1
