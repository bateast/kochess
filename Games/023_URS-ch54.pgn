1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 e6 4.Bg2 d5 {...c6 would be a move-order finesse, as the
text move gives White the option to exchange on d5, although that is not
common.} 5.Nf3 c6 6.O-O Bd6 {the standard position for the Modern Stonewall.} 
7.b3 {the main line.} 7...Qe7 {aimed at preventing Ba3, which would allow White
to exchange off the Bd6.} 8.Bb2 O-O ( 8...b6 {is the major alternative, choosing
to develop the bishop to b7 or a6 and supporting options on the queenside.} ) 
9.Nc3 {this is not considered the best placement for the knight in a Stonewall,
since it has fewer options while on c3.} 9...Bd7 {whenever Black plays this, the
aim is to swing the bishop around to the kingside via e8.} 10.Ne5 {White would
be happy with a piece exchange on e5, as he would improve his control over the
dark squares with the Bd6 gone and have a strong, cramping pawn on e5
afterwards.} 10...Be8 11.Nd3 {this formation rarely appears in the database and
the move is more often seen when the other knight has been developed via d2-f3,
thereby obtaining a lock on e5.} 11...Nbd7 12.e3 {this seems like a generally
passive waiting move. Black wins all three games in the database after this.} 
12...g5 {Black wastes no time in initiating kingside operations.} 13.a4 
{White's forces are clearly more oriented toward the queenside, so he logically
starts expanding there.} 13...Bg6 14.f4 {this seems to play into Black's
strategy by providing a target for the g-pawn and distracting White from
queenside expansion. White may have been worried about an eventual Black ...f4
advance, however.} 14...Bh5 {the immediate ...Bh5 would have allowed White to
block with the f-pawn after f3, although Black was perhaps originally more
interested in fighting for the e4 square.} 15.Qc1 Ne4 {a very thematic knight
move in the Stonewall. While the knight is very active, Black should not be
afraid to exchange it, either, especially since the Nd7 can swing around to f6
to replace it.} 16.fxg5 {this seems a little premature to me.} ( 16.a5 gxf4 
17.Nxf4 Bf7 ) 16...Nxc3 {Black chooses to eliminate the defender of the e2
square, to further activate his light-square bishop and then exchange it.} 
17.Qxc3 Be2 18.Rfe1 Bxd3 {Black exchanges off his "bad" bishop for an excellent
White knight.} 19.Qxd3 Qxg5 20.Ba3 {Black cannot reasonably avoid the exchange.} 
20...Bxa3 ( 20...c5 21.cxd5 {wins a pawn.} ) 21.Rxa3 Nf6 {after the exchanges
end, Black's knight is evidently superior to White's bishop and he has the
initiative on the kingside.} 22.Qf1 h5 23.Qf4 Qxf4 24.gxf4 ( 24.exf4 {seems
safer for White.} ) 24...Kf7 {clearing the way for Rg8 and bringing the king
closer to the center for the endgame.} 25.Ra2 Rg8 26.Kh1 Rg7 27.Bf3 Rag8 
{Black's strategy is simple and dictated by the one open file on the board.} 
28.Rg2 {White's decision to trade down only makes Black's task of penetrating
White's position easier.} 28...Rxg2 29.Bxg2 a5 {prophlyaxis against a further
pawn advance with b4.} 30.Kg1 h4 31.Kf1 Ng4 32.h3 Nf6 {now Black will have the
g3 square available and the Bg2 is further restricted.} 33.Kf2 Rg3 34.c5 Ne4+ 
{the only way to make progress.} 35.Bxe4 {White rids himself of his "bad" bishop
and prevents further penetration by the knight.} 35...fxe4 36.Rh1 Ke8 37.Rg1 
{White decides to avoid passive defense in the rook endgame, although Black's
rook ends up being more active in a decisive way.} ( 37.Rh2 ) 37...Rxh3 38.Rg7 
Rh2+ 39.Kf1 Rh3 40.Kf2 Rh2+ {repetition of moves presumably to make the time
control.} 41.Kf1 Rb2 42.Rxb7 Kd8 43.Kg1 Re2 44.b4 axb4 45.a5 Rxe3 46.a6 Kc8 
47.Rxb4 Ra3 48.Rb6 e3 49.Rxc6+ Kd7 50.Rd6+ Ke7 51.f5 exf5 52.Rxd5 Rxa6 53.c6 
Rxc6 54.Rxf5 Rg6+ {Black's separated passed pawns cannot both be stopped.} 0-1
