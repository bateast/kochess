1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 g6 {the Leningrad Dutch.} 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.Nh3 $5 {the Karlsbad
Variation.} 5...O-O {Pedersen is more in favor of delaying castling. The
database supports his preference.} 6.O-O d6 ( 6...Nc6 {is the other major choice
for Black's development here.} ) 7.d5 Na6 {a thematic idea, the knight is not
"dim on the rim" but will go to c5.} 8.Nc3 Nc5 9.Be3 {this looks a little
strange for the bishop, but it does not have a good choice of squares to develop
to. White's e-pawn has little scope for advancing, so the bishop blocking it is
of less consequence.} ( 9.b4 {Black is not afraid of this, since the knight can
hop to e4 and exchange itself usefully for one of White's key minor pieces.} ) 
9...e5 {another thematic Leningrad idea, gaining space in the center unless
white takes the e-pawn off.} 10.dxe6 Nxe6 11.Ng5 c6 {another standard formation
in the Leningrad, trading the weakening of the d-pawn for more influence on d5
and blunting the Bg2 on the long diagonal. Komodo Dragon prefers the more
forcing ...Ng4, however, as in the following game by Ed Formanek.} ( 11...Ng4

Re7 {0-1, Zvonko Vranesic 2400 - Edward W Formanek 2410, Lloyds Bank op 01,
London (4), 1977.08.29} ) 12.Nxe6 Bxe6 13.Qb3 $6 {White responds to the threat
against the c4 pawn, but this significantly limits the scope of the queen. The
pressure on b7 is not a real threat.} ( 13.b3 {is the engine's preference.} ) 
13...Qe7 $15 {laterally protecting b7, clearing the back rank for the rooks, and
keeping the Queen close to the central action.} 14.Rad1 {a normal-looking
developing move, but now Black takes over the initiative.} 14...Ng4 {with the
positional threat of taking on e3 and doubling White's pawns.} 15.Bf4 Ne5 
{blocking the added pressure to d6 and threatening c4.} 16.Qb4 {keeping up the
counter-pressure on d6.} 16...Rfd8 {shoring up d6. The alternative is to
liquidate by taking on c4, which would give Black an endgame advantage. However,
Paikidze prefers to play on in the middlegame.} ( 16...Nxc4 17.Bxd6 Nxd6 
18.Qxd6 Qxd6 19.Rxd6 Kf7 $17 {Black has the two bishops in an open position, a
more active king, and a 3-2 queenside majority, which add up to a significant
positional advantage, but not necessarily decisive.} ) 17.b3 {correctly
solidifying the c4 pawn's protection, which however is a clear illustration of
the awkwardness of the original (unnecessary) queen move.} 17...g5 {in keeping
with the needs of the position, Black attacks and expands on the kingside.} 
18.Bd2 Rd7 {keeping things solid, as the rook now defends both d6 and b7,
potentially freeing up the Qe7 to move.} 19.Qa3 {White's worst piece is her
queen, so in the absence of anything better, she redeploys it.} 19...Rf8 20.Qc1 
( 20.Qxa7 {is a viable option, but then Black's f-pawn advance has a little more
bite and she does not miss the a-pawn.} 20...f4 $10 ) 20...h6 {choosing to
protect the g5 pawn and let White come to her.} ( 20...f4 {thrusting forward
another, more complicated option recommended by the engine, sacrificing material
for an attack.} 21.gxf4 Ng6 22.fxg5 d5 {it's hard to see a human playing this
way, two pawns down without much visible compensation. However, after something
like} 23.cxd5 cxd5 24.e4 Nh4 25.Nxd5 Bxd5 26.exd5 Nxg2 {Black is even and can
force a perpetual after Kxg2 and ...Qe2. However, Paikidze certainly was not
looking for a draw here.} ) 21.f4 gxf4 22.Bxf4 Kh7 {protecting the h6 pawn and
clearing the g8 square.} ( 22...Qf6 {is also possible.} ) 23.e4 {the e-pawn gets
into the action and challenges the f-pawn.} 23...Ng6 {the correct retreat,
threatening to take off White's strongly-placed bishop. This also opens up the
long diagonal for the Bg7.} 24.Be3 Qd8 $6 {this allows White to seize back the
initiative.} ( 24...f4 {is again preferred by the engine as a pawn sacrifice.} 
25.Bxf4 Bg4 26.Rd3 Qe6 27.Qd2 Be5 28.Bxh6 Rxf1+ 29.Kxf1 Rf7+ {with
compensation.} ) 25.Bh3 {the correct response, attacking and pinning the f5
pawn.} 25...Rdf7 26.Qc2 $6 {in a complicated position, White goes astray and
gives back the initiative.} ( 26.c5 {taking advantage of the pin on the d-pawn.} 
26...d5 27.exd5 cxd5 $16 {and Black is positionally in trouble with her isolated
pawns and bottled-up pieces.} ( 27...Bxd5 28.Nxd5 cxd5 {is even worse, giving
White the two bishops advantage.} ) ) 26...Qe7 {with Black's queen no longer
pinned against the d-pawn, White's advantage evaporates.} 27.Bf4 ( 27.Bxa7 $2 
{pawn snatching would be a mistake, allowing Black's f-pawn to advance with
purpose.} 27...f4 {now White's hanging Bh3 proves to be a tactical liability,
even if exchanged. For example} 28.Bxe6 Qxe6 $19 {and now ...Qh3 is threatened,
while the Qc2 is tied to protecting the Nc3.} ) 27...fxe4 {the engine evaluates
the position as still equal, but now Black has opened up the position for her
pieces.} 28.Bxe6 {forced} 28...Qxe6 29.Nxe4 {now Black can (and must) advance
the d-pawn.} 29...d5 30.Nc5 ( 30.Nf2 {looks awkwardly defensive, but White does
need to think about her kingside weaknesses.} ) 30...Qg4 31.Nd3 Bd4+ {the bishop
takes advantage of the screening Nd3 and goes to an excellent central square
with check.} 32.Kh1 Re8 {the e2 square is the obvious target for placing a rook,
with mate threats to follow. White must think about defense now.} 33.Rde1 
{White chooses to take on the e-file threat directly.} ( 33.Ne1 $5 {and the
queen can go to d3 if needed, while the knight has g2 and f3 available.} ) 
33...Rfe7 {the obvious follow-up, building up on the e-file. Now White needs to
exchange rooks to blunt Black's pressure.} 34.cxd5 $2 {not seeing the danger.} 
( 34.Rxe7+ Rxe7 35.Nc1 dxc4 36.bxc4 b6 $17 {and Black has the advantage, but
there is no knockout blow.} ) 34...Re2 $1 35.Rxe2 Rxe2 {now nothing can save
White.} 36.Qd1 Qh5 {keeping protection of the Re2 while threatening mate on h2.} 
37.g4 Qxd5+ {with mate to follow immediately.} 0-1
