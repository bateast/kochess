1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.Nf3 {this unnamed sideline can also arise from a
2. Nf3 move order. I've actually had this position six times in my tournament
praxis.} 4...Nf6 {this is what I played five times out of six.} ( 4...Nc6 {is as
equally popular as the text move in the database and is more in keeping with
standard Exchange Variation development. It blocks the diagonal to Black's king
and helps guard e5. Used in Annotated Game #171.} ) 5.Ne5 {White is attempting
to chart an independent course in the opening, rather than sticking to normal
development. This approach has been used successfully by a number of top-level
players, although the surprise factor likely plays a role.} 5...g6 {this has
seen more success, scoring around 50 percent, than the other main alternative
...Nc6.} 6.Bb5+ Nbd7 {now Black has this more flexible and slightly less awkward
response to the bishop check.} 7.O-O Bg7 {continuing to develop pieces. White's
Ne5 is in a good position, but moving it twice has allowed Black to catch up in
development.} 8.c3 {supporting the d4 pawn and looking to blunt Black's bishop
on the long diagonal.} 8...O-O 9.f4 {in keeping with the aggressive play
featuring the Ne5. One can see this f-pawn push in some other Caro-Kann
variations as well, having gained popularity in recent years. As with all pawn
advances, it also leaves weaknesses in its wake, and Black now occupies the e4
outpost.} 9...Ne4 10.Bd3 {this is where the bishop normally goes in the Exchange
Variation, so arguably White has simply lost a tempo in development. Black's
knight in turn has been diverted to d7 instead of c6, which seems more helpful
for Black, as it can now move to f6 and support the Ne4.} 10...Ndf6 11.Nd2 Bf5 
$146 {making the strategic decision to maintain the Ne4. The Bf5 development is
also normal in variations with ...g6.} ( 11...Nd6 {was previously played.}

12.Ndf3 e6 {stiffening Black's position on the light squares and also locking
the bishop on the kingside. I admit I would be hesitant to play this kind of
restrictive move, although objectively the Bf5 will have an out after ...Nd6.} 
( 12...Nd6 $5 {is also an idea here.} ) 13.Qe1 {this seems to waste time and put
the queen on a less mobile square, although perhaps the idea was to enable the
queen to eventually swing over to the kingside. Meanwhile, two queenside pieces
remain undeveloped.} 13...Nd6 14.Be2 {the bishop moves again, this time to avoid
an exchange which would lessen White's ability to fight for the light squares.} 
14...b5 {with White retreating forces from the center, Krush now opts to
mobilize her queenside.} 15.h3 {threatening g2-g4, but the bishop has the fine
e4 square to go to.} 15...Qc7 {connecting the rooks and adding to White's
potential pressure on the queenside.} 16.b3 {this weakens c3, but gives White
the idea of pushing the c-pawn, while keeping Black out of c4. It also opens up
the c1-a3 diagonal for the bishop to get out.} 16...Be4 {Krush now chooses to go
for the exchange of bishop for knight.} ( 16...Rfc8 $5 {would activate the
rook.} ) 17.Ba3 Bxf3 18.Rxf3 {this is awkward-looking, but helps support the c3
pawn and gives the rook some mobility along the third rank, perhaps anticipating
an eventual g2-g4.} ( 18.Bxf3 $5 {would instead fight for the e4 square.} ) 
18...Nfe4 {now the results of the bishop for knight trade look good for Black.
Once again there is a strong Ne4, which in this position has greater reach than
the bishop, targeting key squares such as c3 and g3.} 19.Rc1 {further
reinforcing the c-pawn and preparing to advance it.} 19...Rfc8 ( 19...f6 {is
favored by the engines, which show a slight Black plus, but would represent a
shift in strategy and require ...Rfe8 to support the e-pawn.} ) 20.Kh2 {now
White deliberately avoids the critical idea of c3-c4, to her detriment.} ( 
20.c4 dxc4 21.bxc4 bxc4 22.Bxc4 $11 ) 20...a5 ( 20...Qa5 {is the engines'
choice, forcing White to exchange on d6 or drop a pawn. However, White in return
could get some activity and counterplay on the queenside.} 21.Bxd6 Nxd6 22.b4 ( 
22.Bd3 Qxa2 23.Ra1 Qxb3 24.Ra6 ) 22...Qc7 23.a4 ) ( 20...Qb7 $5 {seems like a
good practical choice as well, getting the queen off the c-file, reinforcing the
Ne4, and keeping options open on the queenside.} ) 21.Bd3 {this and White's next
seem like waiting moves, with the idea perhaps of Qc1 afterwards. However, this
gives Black too much time.} 21...Qa7 22.Rc2 {this was the last chance to
liquidate the tension by playing c4.} 22...b4 $1 $17 {now Black's buildup pays
off. The problem for White is that his Rc2 is overloaded, trying to cover both
the a2 and c3 pawns, while the d4 pawn is also under pressure.} 23.cxb4 Rxc2 
24.Bxc2 axb4 25.Bxb4 Qxa2 {breaking up White's queenside pawn duo, but limiting
the reach of Black's queen.} ( 25...Qxd4 {is the choice of the engines, giving
Black central control with a 5v3 majority and a centralized queen.} ) 26.Bd3 
{the bishop moves yet again, and again it seems to be hurting rather than
helping White. Perhaps she is hoping in some long-run compensation for having
the two bishops, but the light-square bishop is hobbled in this structure.} ( 
26.Bxe4 Nxe4 27.Qc1 $17 ) 26...Qb2 {this gets the queen out of the way of the
rook on the a-file and also targets the d4 pawn. Although material is even,
White's two isolated, weak b- and d-pawns and awkward piece placement give Black
a significant edge.} ( 26...Qxb3 $4 27.Bxe4 $18 ) 27.Bxd6 {this must have been
played with some regret, exchanging White's better bishop, but it helps
de-congest White's pieces and removes the Ne4.} 27...Nxd6 28.Qb4 {finally giving
the queen some scope and at least some theoretical hope for counterplay.} 
28...Bf8 {Krush improves her worst piece, with tempo, given its lineup on the
White queen.} 29.Qb6 Qd2 ( 29...Ra2 {played first would keep the initiative and
avoid the rook getting cut off by a potential Ba6.} 30.Bf1 Qd2 $19 ) 30.Bf1 ( 
30.Ba6 $5 {would now interfere with Black's piece coordination and make her
readjust her plans and pieces.} 30...Qa2 31.Bd3 Kg7 $17 ) 30...h5 ( 30...Ra2 ) 
31.Qc6 {White again misses the key idea of Ba6.} 31...Ra1 $19 {now the rook
moves into the attack and White is in trouble.} 32.Qd7 ( 32.Qb6 {would hold the
pawns, at least for now.} ) 32...Qxd4 {White's position now collapses.} 33.Nc6 
$2 {White must be getting desperate at this point.} ( 33.Qd8 Rc1 $19 ) 33...Qf6 
{controlling the e7 square.} 34.b4 {might as well push the passed pawn.} 
34...Ne4 35.Bd3 h4 {now Black takes advantage of White's kingside holes,
preparing another square for the knight.} 36.Qc7 Ng3 {forcing the issue and
winning material, with the threat of ...Rh1#} 37.Rxg3 hxg3+ 38.Kxg3 Ra3 {an
exchange up with excellent activity for the rook and queen, and an exposed enemy
king, the rest of the game is just mopping up for Krush.} 39.Ne5 Bh6 {pretty
much everything wins here.} ( 39...Qf5 $5 ) 40.Qc1 Kg7 41.Qe3 Rb3 42.b5 Rb4 
{now f4 falls to the Black forces.} 43.Ng4 Bxf4+ 44.Kf3 Qc3 45.Qe2 e5 {faced
with further material loss, White resigns.} 0-1
