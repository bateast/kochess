played at high levels over-the-board, theory mostly ignores it in favor of 6.

Normally the bishop has to go to f5 instead.} 7.Be2 e6 8.O-O Qc7 {Bd6 is more
popular here, although both prevent White from playing Bf4.} 9.Nh4 {White scores
75% from here.} 9...Bxe2 10.Qxe2 Nd7 11.c4 O-O-O {obligatory, as the king has
nowhere else to go.} 12.Rd1 {White has tried a lot of things in this position,
but 12. g3 is by far the most played, with the idea of shutting down Black's
play on the g-file. Here are two games where Black managed to draw.} ( 12.g3 h5

standard break in the Caro-Kann main line, the idea being to help activate
Black's pieces. With Black castled queenside it requires a little more bravery.} 
13.d5 {White would of course welcome an exchange on d5, leaving Black with no
central pawns and a horrendous pawn structure on the kingside.} 13...Ne5 ( 
13...Bd6 {is suggested by Houdini. Black is falling behind in development and
needs to generate kingside threats.} 14.dxe6 {is not a refutation because of}

this point it's clear that Black's shattered and vulnerable pawn structure will
be the central focus of the remainder of the game.} ( 16...Bxe5 {appears
somewhat better, although still difficult for Black, as the Bishop can be a
target as well on e5 and has few places to go.} 17.Nf3 ) 17.g3 Qf7 {with the
g-file closed after the previous move, the f-file is the only possible avenue of
attack. This seems to have been the rationale for taking with the pawn on e5, in
order to have it influence f4.} 18.Rd2 Rhf8 19.Kg2 Rd7 ( 19...Bc7 {is Houdini's
recommendation.} 20.Rxd8+ Rxd8 21.Re1 $16 ) 20.Rad1 Rfd8 21.Qe4 {White's pieces
are more mobile and threatening than Black's. At this point Black focuses on
defense, in the hopes that White cannot find a way to practically exploit his
weaknesses.} 21...Kc7 22.Rd3 Qh5 23.Rb3 b6 24.Ra3 a5 25.Rad3 Rg7 26.h3 Rf7

his rook while White attempts to break through.} 29.Rf3 Rfd7 30.Rfd3 {Twofold
repetition.} 30...Rf7 31.b3 {White can afford to make small improvements and
move closer to the time control, as Black has no threats.} 31...Rfd7 32.Nf3

and pick up a pawn in the process.} ( 35.Nxe5 $6 {does not work due to}

this a question mark, as it facilitates White's win.} ( 47...Rg4+ {would allow
Black to control the g-file and prevent the loss of both kingside pawns without
compensation.} 48.Kxf5 ( 48.Kxh5 $6 Kd6 $14 ) 48...Kb7 $16 ) 48.Kxf5 $18 Kd7
