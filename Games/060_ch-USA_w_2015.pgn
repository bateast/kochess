1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 {entering the "Main Line" Caro-Kann, although these days
it's the Advance Variation (3. e5) that is most played at the professional
level.} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 {the Classical Caro-Kann.} 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 
Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3 e6 11.Bd2 {the standard position in this line.
Now Black varies, however.} 11...a5 $5 {this appears to be a new idea. Very
little played, but with some recent high-level games where Black scores well.} 
( 11...Ngf6 {is normally played here.} ) 12.O-O-O {this seems to be an almost
reflexive choice by White and scores 40 percent in the database (the alternative
c4 scores 0 percent). The logic is that Black no longer can castle queenside
safely, so by default must have the king stay in the center or castle kingside.
White therefore castles queenside and keeps the rook on the h-file, for future
attacking possibilities. This does in part play into Black's main idea, however,
which is to gain space on the queenside and play there.} 12...Bb4 {this provokes
White's next move, which however is not forced. The move is universally played
in the database, an indication that it is considered the obvious follow-up idea
and the reason for playing ...a5 in the first place.} 13.c3 ( 13.Ne4 $5 
{ignoring the bishop sortie and spending the tempo on mobilizing the knight is
another option.} ) 13...Be7 {having done its job, the bishop returns to its
standard square. Now White's king is less secure, since the c3 pawn is a
possible target for a future pawn lever.} 14.Qe2 Ngf6 {at this point we have a
standard position, but with c3 and a5 thrown in. Structurally this has to favor
Black a little, but this may be offset by the tempo invested in the pawn move,
unless it is put to further good use.} 15.Ne5 {a standard attacking formation by
White, seizing the central square and freeing up the space in front of the
f-pawn.} 15...O-O {while it will take good defensive (or counter-offensive)
skills to protect the Black king, it's still far better off castled than sitting
on the e-file.} 16.f4 Re8 {this is a standard defensive rook move in this line.
While at first glance it may seem unnecessary, the e6 pawn can become a serious
weak point and tactical focus for White, so the Re8 will help with that, as well
as leaving the f8 square potentially open for a bishop retreat.} 17.Kb1 {this
proactively gets the king off the c-file and protects the a2 pawn.} ( 17.f5 {is
played in the only other game in the database, but Black is able to neutralize
this more aggressive approach.} 17...Bd6 18.fxe6 Rxe6 19.Nf5 Bxe5 20.dxe5 Rxe5 
21.Qf3 Qf8 22.g4 Qc5 23.Be3 Qc4 24.Bd4 Qe2 25.Qxe2 Rxe2 26.g5 Ng4 27.Rdg1 c5

Rab1 49.Rc2 Ra1+ 50.Ra2 Rab1 {1/2-1/2 (50) Bobras,P (2535) -Socko,B (2611)
Germany 2015} ) 17...a4 {Black normally would be looking to play the ...c5 break
around this time, and this would still be a viable way to play. However, with
the advanced a-pawn and White's king on the queenside, the text move is
natural.} 18.Nf1 {this seems like it just wastes time. Although it frees up the
space in front of the g-pawn, so would the alternative Ne4. Perhaps White was
reluctant to let Black exchange a pair of minor pieces on e4, fearing it would
harm her attacking possibilities.} ( 18.Ne4 Nxe4 19.Qxe4 Nxe5 20.fxe5 a3 21.b3 
Bg5 $11 {does look OK for Black, for example.} ) 18...a3 19.b3 c5 $15 {in
contrast with the variation above, White's pieces are uncoordinated and Black's
look well placed to follow up on the ...c5 break.} 20.g4 cxd4 21.g5 {the point
of White's very aggressive play. Black now chooses the wrong path.} 21...dxc3 
$6 ( 21...hxg5 {this is a difficult move to play at the board, since it seems
that White can now crash through on the kingside in a typical attack. However,
this is not the case.} 22.h6 {for example is a typical move that normally
threatens to break everything open.} ( 22.Nxd7 Nxd7 23.h6 g6 24.fxg5 Bxg5 $15 
{is the best the engine can come up with, but Black is fine.} ) 22...Nxe5 
23.h7+ {looks most threatening} ( 23.fxe5 Qd5 $17 ) 23...Kh8 24.fxe5 d3 $19 
{and White has nowhere to go on the h-file, thanks to his own h7 pawn.} ) 
22.gxf6 c2+ ( 22...cxd2 {is similar:} 23.fxe7 Qxe7 24.Nxd2 $16 ) 23.Kxc2 Nxf6 
$16 {Black has sacrificed a piece for two pawns and an attack - which is always
tempting, but only profitable if the attack lasts. Here, White's king appears
open, but after a few moves she is able to consolidate her position.} 24.Kb1 
{playing it safe, which allows Black the chance for compensation.} ( 24.Ng3 
Rc8+ ( 24...Qc7+ 25.Kb1 Rac8 26.Rc1 $16 ) 25.Kb1 Nd5 26.Qb5 $16 ) 24...Rc8 $6 
{this looks like an obvious follow-up, but is not threatening enough.} ( 
24...Qd4 {threatening mate on b2 appears to be Black's best chance for
compensation. It's well worth remembering that Black often needs to have a
centrally-placed queen in order to do well (or even sometimes survive) in the
Classical Caro-Kann.} 25.Bc1 Ne4 $1 {a hard move to spot, since it leaves the
queen hanging. Black will regain the material after forking on c3.} 26.Rxd4 
Nc3+ 27.Ka1 Nxe2 28.Rc4 b5 29.Rc6 Rac8 {looks close to equal.} ) 25.Ng3 {White
has the time to redevelop the knight, heading for e4.} 25...Nd5 26.Rhe1 {this is
too slow.} ( 26.Ne4 ) 26...Qb6 27.Ne4 f5 28.Nf2 {now Black can equalize, but she
instead goes for a tactic on e3 that does not fully work.} 28...Rc3 $6 {here the
rook cannot be captured, but the maneuver Nf2-d3 gives White the advantage,
unlike in the ...Bh4 variation where Black would get the exchange in
compensation.} ( 28...Bh4 29.Nfd3 Bxe1 30.Rxe1 Rc3 $11 ) ( 28...Qd4 {remains a
good idea as well.} ) 29.Nfd3 Rec8 30.Rc1 Rxc1+ 31.Rxc1 Rxc1+ 32.Kxc1 {the
exchanges can only benefit White, due to the material balance.} 32...Qg1+ 
33.Kc2 ( 33.Qe1 $5 ) 33...Qa1 34.Nc1 $14 {although White's king is more exposed,
this is not sufficient compensation for the material, since Black cannot put
together sufficient threats against it.} 34...Bf6 $2 {overlooking White's threat
on the e-file, although White immediately returns the favor.} ( 34...Qb2+ 
35.Kd1 Qd4 $16 {would keep the queen active and centralized, while making the
most of White's king in the center.} ) 35.Ned3 $6 ( 35.Ng6 Qb2+ 36.Kd1 $18 {and
either the e6 or b7 pawn will fall to White's queen.} ) 35...Nc7 ( 35...Kf7 
{would protect e6 less awkwardly and keep the centralized Nd5.} ) 36.Bb4 Bb2 
37.Bd6 Bxc1 38.Nxc1 Qb2+ 39.Kd1 $16 {White has covered all her bases and the
reduced material makes her advantage more clear.} 39...Qd4+ {exchanging on e2
would of course just give Black an obviously lost endgame.} 40.Qd2 Qg1+ 41.Kc2 
Nd5 42.Bxa3 {an obvious move, but threatening the e6 pawn again with the queen
(Qe2) might be more advantageous, as the a3 pawn isn't going anywhere.} 
42...Qh1 43.Nd3 Qxh5 {Black is still fighting hard and looking for imbalances -
in this case kingside pawns to match White's queenside pawn threat - that can
give her drawing chances.} 44.Bb2 Qf3 45.a4 h5 46.Bd4 h4 47.Qf2 Qh5 48.Qg1 Qf7 
$6 {Black gives up the queen's activity, which has served her so well up to this
point.} ( 48...Qe2+ ) ( 48...Qh6 {would alternatively maintain support for the
h-pawn while pressuring f4.} ) 49.Kb2 Nf6 50.Qg5 {White in contrast now muscles
in with her queen.} 50...h3 {it's looking desperate for Black now.} 51.Nf2 $19 
( 51.Qg3 {is simpler and better, guaranteeing the loss of the h-pawn.} ) 
51...h2 52.Qh4 {this allows Black to start making threats again.} ( 52.Qg2 
{interestingly is the only move that retains White's significant advantage,
again due to forcing the issue with the h-pawn. Black unlike in the game cannot
play ...Qf7 in response, as then the response would simply be Bxf6, with the
g-pawn pinned.} ) 52...Qd7 53.Bxf6 $6 {White (perhaps in time trouble) seems to
want to simplify, even at the cost of material.} ( 53.Bc3 $5 ) 53...Qd2+ $1 
{this intermediate move equalizes, as opposes to simply recapturing on f6
immediately.} 54.Ka3 Qd6+ $2 {unfortunately, the recapture was now necessary for
Black to get back in the game.} ( 54...gxf6 {and now whatever White does, Black
will be able to get a perpetual after playing ...Qc1+} ) 55.b4 gxf6 56.Qxh2 $18 
{in contrast with the above variation, Black's queen is now out of position and
has to spend a tempo, giving White time to act.} 56...Qd4 57.Qg3+ Kh8 58.Nd3 ( 
58.a5 $5 {passed pawns must be pushed!} ) 58...Qc3+ 59.Ka2 b6 60.Qe3 Kh7 61.Qe2 
Kg6 62.Qd1 e5 {to Black's credit, she continues to fight, taking whatever space
White will give her.} 63.Qg1+ Kf7 64.Qd1 Kg6 65.Qg1+ Kf7 66.Qd1 Kg6 67.Qg1+ 
{and White takes the draw, evidently not seeing a way to make progress.} 1/2-1/2
