1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.O-O O-O 6.c3 {White apparently wants to
avoid a theoretical duel in the Leningrad variation, settling for an uncommon
solid-seeming move rather than the usual c4. The immediate logic is obvious, to
reinforce the d4 strongpoint, but the line is certainly less challenging to
Black. One difference that Black should keep in mind, though, is that White now
has Qb3+ without a pawn blocking the diagonal.} 6...a5 {Black cheekily answers
with an offbeat response of his own. This pawn move seeks to restrain White's
potential follow-up play on the queenside, including b4. Prior to this game,
however, it scored horribly, with no Black wins and White scoring a similar
number of wins and draws.} 7.Nbd2 {the natural square (c3) having been occupied,
White needs to take some extra time to get his knight developed. From here White
may also think about supporting the e4 advance.} 7...Nc6 {when Black can get
away with this knight development in the Leningrad, it's usually a good idea to
play it, since it fights directly for e5. The usual advance d5 here is not
playable for White, due to the c-pawn being a square short of its usual post.} 
8.Re1 d5 {a strong central reaction. Black sees that exerting control over e4
and c4 is more important than any potential resulting pawn structure
weaknesses.} 9.Nb3 {the knight has now taken two moves to get to a
not-very-useful square.} 9...Ne4 {another move Dutch players always love to be
able to execute unchallenged.} 10.a4 {otherwise Black threatens to push the
a-pawn and kick the hapless Nb3.} 10...e6 {the structure is now a hybrid of
Stonewall and Leningrad. However, the main point of the move was not the pawn
placement, but rather to open the diagonal and support Black's following move.} 
11.Bf4 g5 {yet another favorite move in the Dutch. Although Houdini still rates
the position as equal, the fact that Black has been able to consistently play
his desired thematic moves and take over the initiative this early is bad news
for White.} 12.Be5 Bh6 {Black chooses to avoid exchanging the Bg7 while also
preventing White from establishing a useful outpost on e5.} ( 12...Nxe5 13.Nxe5 
Qe7 $11 ) 13.Rf1 {it seems that White is already running out of good moves and
can do little in the face of Black's initiative.} 13...g4 $15 14.Ne1 Nxe5 {now
Black exchanges, with the knight out of the way.} 15.dxe5 {now the pawn on e5
will be a source of weakness for White.} 15...c5 {playing this without
preparation is possible for Black, although perhaps not the strongest
continuation.} ( 15...b6 {is favored by Houdini.} ) 16.Bxe4 dxe4 17.Nxc5 Qb6 
18.b4 $6 ( 18.Nb3 {instead would allow White to regroup and address his
backwards development while Black spends time regaining the pawn.} 18...Bg7 
19.Qc2 Bxe5 20.Ng2 $11 ) 18...Rd8 {an easy decision to seize the only open
file.} 19.Qb3 {White now attends to his weak b-pawn, but Black is able to
continue making threats and improving his pieces without impediment.} 19...Rd5 
{a powerful centralization move, threatening both e5 and c5 due to the pin of
the b4 pawn against the unprotected Qb3.} 20.Qc4 $2 {unfortunately for White,
this just moves into another pin.} ( 20.Qb1 ) 20...Qc7 {attacking e5 again and
pinning the Nc5. White has no good way to meet all the Black threats.} 21.Nc2 
$17 {the least worst option, leaving the Nc5 to its fate but trying to stir up
some counterplay.} ( 21.Qa2 {withdrawing the queen helps, but is not sufficient
to get White out of danger in the rest of his position.} 21...axb4 22.cxb4 Rd2 
{made possible by the offside yet influential Bh6.} 23.Qb1 Qxe5 24.Ra2 Rxa2 
25.Qxa2 b6 26.Nb3 Qd5 $19 {and now Black's two bishops are going to carve White
up, assisted as needed by his central pawns and more active major pieces.} ) ( 
21.Qb5 {would be a perhaps too-obvious try for a swindle.} 21...b6 $2 ( 
21...Kf7 $19 ) 22.Qe8+ Kg7 23.Nxe6+ Bxe6 24.Qxe6 Rxe5 25.Qb3 ) 21...b6 22.Nd4 
{the point being that the knight now threatens to take on f5, with some
counterplay, as the Rd5 would be hanging if Black recaptured with the e-pawn.} 
22...Rxe5 {Black (perhaps in some time pressure?) goes for the safe-looking
choice.} ( 22...bxc5 {simply taking the piece, however, looks best.} 23.Nxf5 
Bg7 $17 {and regardless of what White does, Black takes the e-pawn and has a
fine position.} ) 23.Nb5 Qe7 24.Nb3 $15 {White has managed to extricate himself
from the pin, with only a slightly worse game according to the engine, although
Black still looks threatening and the defender will have to walk a tightrope.
Unfortunately, White cannot maintain equilibrium.} 24...e3 {the only real try
for an advantage.} 25.Qd4 ( 25.N3d4 {is preferred by the engine, but this is not
at all obvious.} ) 25...exf2+ 26.Rxf2 Re4 {the strongest option for the rook,
attacking the queen and keeping control of e3, with the threat of ...Be3.} 
27.Qxb6 axb4 ( 27...Be3 ) 28.cxb4 $2 {after this White is lost.} ( 28.Nd6 {the
only move that lets White keep equality, according to the engine. A sample
line:} 28...Be3 29.Qc6 Bxf2+ 30.Kxf2 Qa7+ 31.Qc5 Qxc5+ 32.Nxc5 Re5 33.cxb4 $11 
{although down an exchange for a pawn, the two connected passed pawns should be
enough compensation.} ) 28...Be3 ( 28...Rxb4 {also wins.} ) 29.N3d4 ( 29.Qc6 
{here does not work due to} 29...Bb7 {which would be prevented in the above
variation by the Nd6.} ) 29...Bb7 30.Rd1 Ra6 31.Qc5 Qxc5 {Black decides to
accept the trade and exchange down into a simpler won position.} 32.bxc5 Re5 
33.Nd6 Ba8 34.Nc4 Bxf2+ {Black is forced to finally pull the trigger on the
pinned rook to win the exchange.} 35.Kxf2 Rxc5 {White has no compensation for
the exchange and Black's rooks and bishop can run rampant in the position.} 
36.Ne3 Kf7 37.Nb3 Rc3 38.Nc1 Be4 39.Na2 Ra3 {the a-pawn will fall and then Black
will just chew White up with his stronger pieces and extra pawn.} 0-1
