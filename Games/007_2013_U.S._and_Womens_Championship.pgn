9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3 e6 11.Bf4 {the first deviation from the game we saw in round
2 (Metchik-Onischuk), which featured the other main choice, Bd2, in which White
goes for more straightforward development. The text move is a little more
aggressive but can sometimes transpose back, if both players allow; however,
that doesn't occur in this game.} 11...Qa5+ {the standard response.} 12.Bd2 Bb4 
{Black scores quite well in this line (54 percent).} ( 12...Qc7 {is the old
Caro-Kann main line, where both sides usually castle queenside. It has a solid
but un-dynamic reputation.} ) 13.c3 Be7 14.c4 Qc7 {this move is the overwhelming
favorite, but Black ends up in a position-type similar to the old main line,
with queenside castling.} ( 14...Qa6 {is an interesting idea played by some
professional Caro-Kann players such as Bareev and Khenkin who aren't afraid to
try new things. Here's a game by Khenkin:} 15.O-O Ngf6 16.Rfe1 Rd8 17.Qe2 O-O

Ngf6 16.Rde1 O-O-O {interestingly, all of Black's options score 50 percent here,
although with a relatively small database sample. I would personally prefer to
castle kingside here, although White looks to have good attacking possibilities
afterwards, since Black would have much a freer hand on the queenside and
center.} 17.Qe2 Rhe8 $146 ( 17...Ng4 {was played in the only game in the
database with this position. This seems like an effective move for the knight as
it helps cover e5 and eyes f2.} 18.Kb1 Rhe8 19.Bc3 Kb8 20.Nd2 Ngf6 21.Nge4 Nxe4

(2570) Bad Wiessee 2006} ) 18.Kb1 {the king needs to get off the c-file and away
from the c1-h6 diagonal, which are latent potential tactical weaknesses. The
move also covers a2.} 18...Bd6 19.Rh4 c5 {Black as available to her both of the
classic Caro-Kann pawn breaks, on c5 and e5. With the king on c8, I would prefer
the e5 break.} ( 19...e5 20.c5 Bf8 21.Nxe5 Bxc5 ) 20.Ne4 Nxe4 21.Qxe4 
{capturing with the rook seems like a more obvious follow-up to her 19th move.} 
21...Nf6 ( 21...cxd4 {is preferred by Houdini, pressing on with the opportunity
provided by the pawn break to disrupt White's center and leaving c5 for the
knight.} 22.Nxd4 Be7 23.Nb5 Qb6 24.Rh3 a6 ) 22.Qc2 cxd4 23.Nxd4 Bc5 {compare
Black's piece placement with the move 21 variation, which seems more effective.} 
24.Nb5 Qc6 25.Be3 ( 25.b4 {would be the aggressive choice and would take
advantage of the Rh4 placement to support the fourth rank.} 25...a6 26.bxc5 
axb5 27.cxb5 Qxb5+ 28.Rb4 ) 25...Bxe3 26.fxe3 {this doesn't seem to have been a
very effective trade for White, who is now saddled with the isolated e-pawn,
although her pieces are more active. Note how the Nf6 is poorly placed, with
most of its squares taken away, so it should reposition itself, probably via
d7.} 26...Qc5 ( 26...Kb8 {is Houdini's choice, with the king vacating the
c-file, covering a7 and enjoying the fact there is no longer a White dark-square
bishop.} ) 27.a3 a6 28.Nc3 Qg5 $15 {Black is starting to generate some threats
and take over the initiative here.} 29.Rh3 Nxh5 {Black however gets distracted
by the pawn and White quickly regains the initiative. The knight is effectively
out of the game on h5, which White immediately takes advantage of.} ( 29...Kb8 
$5 ) 30.Ne4 Qe5 31.c5 Re7 32.Nd6+ Kb8 33.b4 Nf6 {Black understands the need to
get the knight back in the fight.} 34.e4 Rc7 35.Rd3 Rdd7 $2 {leaving the queen
on a vulnerable square.} ( 35...Qf4 {looks reasonable, keeping pressure on e4.} 
) 36.Nc4 Qg5 37.Nb6 {suddenly Black has no way to avoid White's threats from the
heavy pieces on the d-file and the Nb6, which threaten mate or significant
material loss.} 37...Ka7 ( 37...Rxd3 38.Qxd3 Ng8 ( 38...Ng4 39.Rd1 Ka7 40.Qd8 
Qxd8 41.Rxd8 {and Black gets mated in the corner.} ) 39.Rf1 {and now White can
follows up with Qd6 and Rd1.} ) ( 37...e5 38.Red1 Qg4 39.Nxd7+ Nxd7 $18 {with a
crushing position.} ) 38.Nxd7 $16 {White takes the safe advantage.} ( 38.Red1 
$18 {would lead to a much larger advantage, due to White's theats down the
d-file leading to mate threats.} ) 38...Nxd7 39.Qd2 Qe7 40.Qf4 e5 41.Qg4 f6 
42.Red1 Qf7 43.Kb2 {this covers the b3 square.} ( 43.Rxd7 $2 Qb3+ {with a
perpetual.} ) 43...Nf8 $2 {this withdraws a defender from Black's king and again
White pounces on the errant knight move.} ( 43...Nb8 ) 44.Rd6 $18 g6 45.Rf1 h5 
46.Qh3 Nh7 47.Qe3 {Black's knight is now almost buried again on h7 and White has
too much firepower for Black to repel.} 47...Rc6 48.Rxc6 bxc6 49.Qd2 Kb7 50.Qd8 
Qc7 51.Qe8 {an excellent example of when not to trade down when you are in a
much stronger position.} 51...Qc8 52.Qxg6 Qd7 53.Kc2 {White continues to
effectively employ her king to shut out Black's queen from penetrating, as well
as preparing to move the rook to the d-file.} 53...h4 54.Rd1 Qe7 55.Rd6 {White
now completely dominates.} 55...Kc7 56.Kd3 Kb7 57.Qg4 Nf8 58.Qf5 Qf7 59.Qxf6

correct moment for the queens to come off the board occurred and the win is now
trivial.} 65...Nd7 66.Rf7 Kc8 67.Rxf4 Ne5 68.Rxh4 Nc4 69.Rh3 1-0
