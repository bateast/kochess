1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 {this simplifies White's opening choices, as it makes little
sense not to exchange the c-pawn for Black's central d-pawn.} 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.g3 
{the most popular continuation. The more flexible Nf3 also scores as well,
around 57 percent in the database.} 4...e5 {staking out territory in the center
(which Nf3 would have prevented).} 5.Bg2 {forcing Black to choose what to do
with the Nd5.} 5...Nb6 {preferred and best scoring option (around 50 percent) .} 
6.d3 {still avoiding committing the other knight. Moving the d-pawn seems
necessary in any scenario for White.} 6...Be7 7.Be3 {the bishop development to
e3 is a standard idea in some lines of the English. Here, f4 and g5 are out and
d2 would be more passive. The Black king's knight is also on b6 rather than f6
as normal, so cannot harass it.} 7...O-O 8.Rc1 {activating the rook on the
half-open c-file.} 8...Re8 9.Nf3 {the knight is finally developed.} ( 9.a3 {is
often played here.} ) 9...Nc6 {the e-pawn must be protected.} 10.O-O Bf8 
{overprotecting the e-pawn and choosing to give the bishop a defensive role on
the kingside, which is lacking the usual protection of a knight.} 11.a4 {White
has played a variety of moves here. Normally one would expect an a-pawn thrust
to be more consistent with a White rook on a1. One recent high-level
alternative:} ( 11.Bg5 Qd7 12.a3 h6 13.Bd2 Qd8 14.Ne4 a5 15.Nc5 a4 16.Qc2 Ra7

$6 {Black blocks the a-pawn's further advance, but this was not currently
threatened. Perhaps it was a deliberate invitation to exchange on b6 and give
Black the two bishops, although White seems to inflict enough structural damage
to more than compensate for that.} 12.Bxb6 ( 12.d4 $5 {is the engine line and
actually has been played in a few games. The point is that exchanges on d4 favor
White's piece activity.} 12...exd4 ( 12...Nc4 {is what the engines give} 13.Nb5

{now White has b5 as an excellent outpost for the knight.} 13...Be6 {this seems
to unnecessarily weaken the e-pawn, by blocking the Re8.} 14.d4 {now Black
cannot maintain the pawn on e5.} 14...e4 ( 14...exd4 {is the other option, which
likely will lead to wholesale liquidation:} 15.Nfxd4 Bg4 16.Nxc6 bxc6 17.Bxc6 
Bxe2 18.Qxd8 Raxd8 19.Bxe8 Bxf1 20.Kxf1 Rxe8 $11 ) 15.Ne1 {this is the most
challenging option for White, avoiding a piece exchange and activating the
strong Bg2. The knight will later emerge via g2.} ( 15.Ne5 {is less ambitious
and gives Black more play.} 15...Nxe5 16.dxe5 Qxd1 17.Rfxd1 Bb3 18.Rd4 Rxe5 $11 
) 15...f5 ( 15...Rc8 $5 {may be better, but is a typical complicated engine
line.} 16.Bxe4 Nxd4 17.Rxc8 Bxc8 18.Qxd4 Qxd4 19.Bxh7+ Kxh7 20.Nxd4 $11 ) 16.f3 
{a forcing move which causes Black to go wrong.} 16...Bd5 $2 {this will allow
White to force a favorable structure in the center.} ( 16...exf3 17.Bxf3 {and
White should have a comfortable game after e2-e3 and Ng2, but the engine rates
it as equal.} ) 17.fxe4 fxe4 ( 17...Bxe4 {would give White too much of a free
hand in the center.} ) 18.e3 {White's d-pawn is now protected and passed, while
Black's isolated e-pawn requires defending.} 18...g6 {Black needs to activate
his dark-square bishop.} 19.Bh3 {an illuminating move. White seizes a better
diagonal for his bishop, as the e4 pawn is doubly protected. This leaves the Bh3
superior to its Black counterpart.} 19...Bh6 ( 19...Be6 $2 {attempting to
exchange bishops does not work tactically.} 20.Bxe6+ Rxe6 21.Qb3 Qe7 22.d5 $18 
) 20.Ng2 {getting the knight back into the action, protecting e3 and looking to
go to f4. At this point White is strategically winning, as his pieces are all
better placed than Black's.} 20...Re7 21.Nf4 {this is not as forcing as some
other possibilities.} ( 21.Rf6 $1 {is the engine move, which of course is not at
all obvious. The point is that the rook threatens to go to d6, while White can
also play Qg4 and Rcf1, mobilizing his heavy pieces to dominate.} 21...Nb4 
22.Qg4 $16 ) ( 21.Qg4 $5 {with the idea of Qh4 also looks very good.} ) 
21...Nb4 {protecting the Bd5 again.} 22.Qg4 Nd3 $4 {Black makes a bid for
counterplay which fails to a tactic.} ( 22...Bxf4 {Black likely hesitated to
give up the two bishops, even though it was best for defense.} 23.gxf4 $14 ) 
23.Nxd5 Nxc1 ( 23...Qxd5 24.Rc8+ Rxc8 25.Qxc8+ Kg7 26.Qf8# {White's control of
the f-file pays off.} ) 24.Qh4 $1 {with a double attack on e7 and h6.} ( 
24.Nxe7+ Qxe7 25.Nc3 {trapping the knight also should win.} ) 24...Qxd5 ( 
24...Bf8 {after the exchanges Black just ends up a piece down.} 25.Nxe7+ Qxe7
