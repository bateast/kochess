1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 {the Two Knights Caro-Kann.} 3...Bg4 {the most effective
response by Black, who however will need to immediately exchange bishop for
knight, as the bishop retreat after h3 is not as effective. This is not a bad
trade-off, however, as the Nf3 is a valuable attacking piece and Black will be
able to build a strong pawn skeleton on the light squares.} 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 e6 
6.Be2 Nf6 7.O-O ( 7.e5 {looks tempting, but scores poorly for White, as
attacking prospects are limited and Black will get more counterplay in the
center. An example game:} 7...Nfd7 8.Qg3 a6 9.O-O c5 10.d3 Nc6 11.f4 g6 12.Kh1

{0-1, Ezio Righi 2116 - Peter Long 2302, Olympiad-39, Khanty-Mansiysk (6.3),
2010.09.27} ) 7...Nbd7 {a noncommittal developing move, prompting White to play
the obvious next move to occupy the center and free the Bc1.} ( 7...Bc5 $5 {is
the next most popular and scores slightly better in the database. The point of
course is to prevent d4.} ) 8.d4 dxe4 {Black needs to exchange in the center,
otherwise White's presence becomes too strong.} 9.Nxe4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4 Nf6 11.Qd3 
{the situation in the center is now more resolved, with a standard Caro-Kann
pawn structure for both sides and White having the two bishops, a slight
long-term advantage.} 11...Qc7 {the queen move is logical, since it occupies the
h2-b8 diagonal and at least temporarily prevents White developing with Bf4.
However, it may be a premature commitment of Black's strongest piece.} ( 
11...Be7 {is most played here, as the logical square for the bishop and to
immediately prepare kingside castling.} ) 12.Rd1 {the best file for the rook,
supporting the d-pawn again and therefore allowing the Qd3 more flexibility.} 
12...Be7 13.a4 {a recently tried move, this indicates White intends to focus her
attantion on the queenside. The easiest and best response appears to be simply
to block further progress of the a-pawn and restrain the White b-pawn's
advance.} 13...a5 14.Bd2 {it is not easy for White to find a good square for
this bishop and it is awkwardly transferred here to e1.} 14...O-O 15.Be1 Rfd8 
{Black logically places her rook on the best file, opposing White's pieces. The
game is equal.} 16.Qc4 {neither side has obvious weaknesses to target, so the
middlegame will necessarily feature some maneuvering. Black's plan is easier to
identify, however: doubling rooks on the d-file and threatening a pawn break to
open it up. The text move is not bad for White, but it does put the queen in the
way of the c-pawn.} 16...Rd7 17.Bf3 {the bishop was not doing much on the other
diagonal, so f3 is a better square for it.} 17...Rad8 18.c3 {logically
reinforcing d4. Also, White has little better.} 18...e5 {Nimzovich famously
wrote "the threat is stronger than the execution" - which seems true here. Black
is fine after the resulting exchanges, but could have maintained the tension.} 
19.dxe5 Qxe5 20.Qe2 Qxe2 21.Bxe2 Nd5 {having previously opted for exchanges, now
Black chooses to wait and maneuvers the bishop to f6. It's not clear if this is
better, however.} ( 21...Rxd1 22.Rxd1 Rxd1 23.Bxd1 Kf8 $10 ) 22.g3 {controlling
the f4 square.} 22...Bf6 {this restrains the advance of White's b-pawn, but
gives up its mobility along the f8-a3 diagonal and leaves the bishop biting on
the c3 pawn.} 23.Bf3 {returning to its previous square, but now it appears less
effective.} ( 23.Bg4 $5 ) 23...Nb6 {now we get another exchange in any case.} 
24.Rxd7 Nxd7 {this is better because the knight goes to a better square
afterwards.} 25.Ra2 {this appears to be a waiting move, to see what Black will
do.} 25...Ne5 26.Be2 Nd3 {forcing the minor piece exchange. White can choose
which bishop, however.} 27.Bxd3 Rxd3 28.Ra3 {from this point the position is
very balanced, with near- symmetrical pawn structures. Black has better piece
activity, but there is no way to make real progress.} ( 28.Ra1 $5 ) 28...Be7 
29.Ra1 f5 {contesting g4 and opening the diagonal for Black's king to more
quickly head toward the center.} 30.Kf1 {White moves to centralize her king as
well, one of the most fundamental endgame principles.} 30...Kf7 31.Ke2 Rd7 
32.b4 {White chooses to simplify things on the queenside.} 32...axb4 33.cxb4 
Bf6 34.Rc1 Rd5 {defending against the idea of a White pawn advance on the
queenside.} 35.a5 Re5+ 36.Kf1 {White can penetrate with the king, but cannot do
any damage thereby.} ( 36.Kd3 Rd5+ 37.Kc4 Rd4+ 38.Kc5 Rd5+ 39.Kb6 Rb5+ $10 ) 
36...Rb5 37.a6 {the series of exchanges that result mean the position will be
drawn.} 37...bxa6 38.Rxc6 Be7 39.Rxa6 Bxb4 40.Bxb4 Rxb4 {short of a blunder,
there is no possible result other than a draw at this point.} 41.Ke2 Rb3 42.h4 
h5 43.Kf1 g6 44.Kg2 Rc3 45.Rb6 Rd3 46.Ra6 Rc3 47.Rb6 Rd3 48.Ra6 Rc3 1/2-1/2
