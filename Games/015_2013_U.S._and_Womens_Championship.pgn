1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6 {Norowitz is persistent,
still playing the Bronstein-Larsen after losses with it in two previous rounds.} 
6.Nf3 {not the most challenging continuation, as it invites Black to develop his
bishop with a pin.} 6...Bg4 7.Be2 e6 8.O-O Bd6 {instead of the ...Qc7 played in
the first round against Christiansen.} 9.c4 Rg8 {a move that Norowitz never
managed to get in during the round 1 game.} 10.Kh1 Nd7 11.d5 Qe7 {Norowitz now
varies from Tringov-Smyslov (!), presented below as a fine example of an
attacking game in this opening line.} ( 11...Nc5 12.Nd4 f5 13.Bxg4 Rxg4 14.h3 
Qf6 15.Nf3 Rxc4 16.dxc6 Ne4 17.cxb7 Rb8 18.Qd3 Rb4 19.Be3 R4xb7 20.b3 Rd7

35.Re1 a5 36.Qa3 Rc3 37.Kh2 Rxg3 38.Qxa5 Qh4 {0-1 (38) Tringov,G-Smyslov,V
Havana 1965} ) 12.dxc6 bxc6 13.Nd4 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 {White has exchanged off another
pair of minor pieces, a good strategic move that brings him closer to the
endgame.} 14...Rc8 15.Qh5 {White decides to go pawn hunting, which does not turn
out well for him.} ( 15.Be3 {seems solid.} ) 15...f5 {a key move idea in this
variation (also played earlier on in the Smyslov game given above). The diagonal
is opened up for Black's queen and the doubled pawn is used to grab space in
White's territory.} 16.Qxh7 Nf6 {Black uses the pawn sacrifice to activate his
pieces, moving his knight into the game and also making the Bd6 a much more
powerful piece with the h-file now open for attacking purposes (targeting the h2
pawn).} 17.Qh3 Ng4 18.g3 {this cuts off the Black bishop, but causes additional
problems for White.} ( 18.f3 Nxh2 19.Re1 Nf1 {is a wild line, in which Black is
OK because of the latent threat of a pin on the h-file, for example} 20.Rxf1 $2 
( 20.Nxf5 Ng3+ 21.Nxg3 Bxg3 22.Re2 $11 ) 20...Qf6 $19 ) ( 18.Nf3 {may be a more
solid defense.} ) 18...Bc5 $15 19.f3 Bxd4 20.fxg4 Rxg4 {Black has now regained
his sacrificed pawn and his pieces are certainly more active and better placed,
although the position is still quite sharp.} 21.Qg2 Qb4 22.Bf4 {now White
chooses to sacrifice the c-pawn, but his compensation is not as robust as
Black's was earlier.} ( 22.Qc2 $5 ) 22...Qxc4 23.Rfd1 e5 $17 {now Black gets
rolling in the center and the strength of this passed pawn proves to be the
deciding factor in the end.} 24.Rac1 Qe6 25.Re1 f6 {a remarkable display of how
Black's normally weak pawn grouping can become a strength.} 26.Be3 Kf7 27.Bxd4 
Rxd4 28.Rf1 Kg6 {a bold and effective use of the king. Ironically White's two
kingside pawns serve as effective shields for Black's king.} ( 28...e4 {was also
possible.} ) 29.Rc2 Rcd8 {Black's domination of the central squares and files is
now complete.} 30.h4 ( 30.Rxc6 Qxa2 31.h4 Rd1 $19 ) 30...Rd1 31.Rxd1 Rxd1+ 
32.Kh2 Qd5 $19 33.Rf2 ( 33.Qxd5 cxd5 {and Black's central pawns will be
unstoppable.} ) 33...Qxg2+ {Black prefers to trade queens here and head into the
less complicated rook ending.} 34.Kxg2 $17 Rd4 ( 34...c5 $5 ) 35.Rc2 f4 36.g4 ( 
36.Rxc6 $2 {would be bad due to} 36...Rd2+ {and now White loses the g-pawn in
all variations, for example} 37.Kh3 Rd3 38.Kh2 Rxg3 ) ( 36.gxf4 Rxf4 37.Kg3 
{might be a more stubborn defense.} ) 36...Rd3 $19 {Black's rook dominates
White's back ranks and can enable the Black pawns to roll forward.} 37.Kh2 Rg3 
38.Rg2 Rxg2+ 39.Kxg2 e4 {now Black's extra f-pawn ensures his victory, a fitting
end for a Bronstein-Larsen game!} 0-1
