1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 Bf5 {the traditional approach to the Slow Slav.} 
5.Nc3 e6 6.Nh4 Bg6 7.Nxg6 hxg6 8.Bd2 Nbd7 9.Qc2 Be7 {an older move that has
given way to ...Bd6, but nonetheless has a better overall score in the
database.} 10.h3 a6 11.Be2 Rc8 ( 11...O-O {seems like a solid choice here, as
White has no threats for the moment.} ) 12.O-O {a very reasonable move, but now
out of the database.} 12...dxc4 {starting a largely forced sequence that
simplifies the structure in the center and on the c-file.} 13.Bxc4 b5 14.Be2 c5 
15.dxc5 Rxc5 ( 15...Nxc5 {would be more standard and lead to equality.} ) 16.b4 
Rc7 {apparently the idea behind the rook capture on the previous move, in order
to leave c8 available for an eventual doubling of heavy pieces on the file. This
appears to be a little slow and awkward, however, leaving Black slightly behind
in development.} 17.Qb3 Nb6 ( 17...O-O $5 ) 18.Rfd1 Nc4 19.Be1 {White correctly
keeps the two bishops on the board, as part of his only chance for an advantage
in the endgame. Black also now has to be careful.} 19...Qb8 {interestingly, this
is the only move that does not lead to a significant White advantage, as the
pawn advance a4 threatens to crack open the queenside and win a pawn. Black's
failure to castle earlier helps White in that regard.} ( {for example:} 
19...Qc8 20.a4 Nd6 21.axb5 axb5 22.Nxb5 Nxb5 23.Bxb5+ Kf8 $18 ) 20.a4 O-O 
21.axb5 axb5 22.Ra6 {after this move, which releases the pressure by not making
any new threats, Black consolidates his position and both sides head for a
draw.} ( 22.Rd4 Ne5 23.Nxb5 Rb7 24.Qa4 Nd5 25.Rb1 $14 {White may not in the end
be able to keep the b-pawn, but Black has no other compensation and will have to
struggle to regain the material.} ) 22...Rfc8 23.Rda1 Kh7 24.Ra8 Qb6 25.R8a6 
Qb8 26.Ra8 Qb6 27.R8a6 Qb8 28.Ra8 Qb6 29.R8a6 1/2-1/2
