1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 {the Exchange Slav, which has the reputation for being a
very drawish opening. It can be, but usually only if both players are happy with
a draw.} 3...cxd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 {varying with ...a6 or ...Qb6 here would
be one way to go for a more unbalanced position.} 6.Bf4 Nh5 {the classic
treatment of the variation is to keep symmetry with ...Bf5. The text move in
fact scores over 50 percent in the database.} 7.Bd2 {the usual choice, White
chooses a safe path for the bishop, implicitly arguing that while the Bd2 isn't
on a great square, the Nh5 is on a worse one.} 7...e6 {indicating that Black is
looking for an unbalanced game.} ( 7...Nf6 {is the drawing line, if Black is
willing to accept that outcome. White is faced with the choice of continuing
play with his bishop on d2, moving it to another substandard square, or
repeating moves.} ) 8.e3 Bd6 9.Ne5 g6 {only a handful of games are in the
database, but this scores 70 percent for White. Weakening the dark-square
complex like this looks strange, but White is not in a position to take
advantage of it, with his relevant bishop locked in. It also allows the
possibility of Nh5-g7-f5 at some point.} ( 9...Nf6 {is the other main choice,
which scores better for Black overall, although not in the following high-level
example, also a long endgame win fo White.} 10.f4 O-O 11.Bd3 Ne7 12.O-O b6

(2729)-Morozevich,A (2721) Monte Carlo 2006} ) 10.Nb5 Be7 {Black needs to keep
the bishop on the board to help cover the dark squares.} 11.Bd3 O-O 12.O-O a6 
$11 {Black has apparently achieved what he intended, reaching equality out of
the opening but in a relatively unbalanced position which may give him chances
to pursue a win.} 13.Nc3 Bd6 {this appears to lose Black time and give White
some initiative.} ( 13...Nxe5 {seems logical here, getting rid of the strong
Ne5, which is an analagous theme in the Stonewall.} ) 14.f4 {now exchanging on
e5 would be favorable for White, giving him a cramping pawn on e5 and the
half-open f-file.} 14...Bd7 15.Qf3 ( 15.Na4 {is Houdini's choice here, with the
idea of pursuing a queenside strategy and following up with Rc1.} ) 15...Be8 ( 
15...f5 {is another option, going for a Stonewall-like formation that would shut
White down on the kingside.} ) 16.Qh3 Ng7 17.Rf3 {an aggressive-looking move
that goes nowhere for White and causes him to lose time repositioning the rook
later.} ( 17.Rac1 $5 ) 17...f6 18.Ng4 h5 19.Nf2 f5 {this seems unnecessary, as
the Be8 already covers g6 (why it was moved there in the first place, one would
imagine).} ( 19...Rc8 $5 {immediately looks fine.} ) 20.Bf1 Rc8 21.Rd1 {at this
point we have a largely closed position with a lot of pieces clogging up the
board. Both sides attempt to reposition themselves.} 21...Rf7 ( 21...Bf7 
{followed by Ng7-e8-f6 would bring the knight back into the game.} ) 22.Nd3 
Rfc7 {While the doubled rooks look good, it's unclear what they can accomplish
on the c-file.} 23.Be1 Be7 24.Rf2 Bf7 {as happened earlier, Houdini again
prefers a queenside strategy starting with Na4, looking to exploit the hole on
b6.} 25.Ne5 ( 25.Na4 {as happened earlier, Houdini again prefers a queenside
strategy starting with the text move, looking to exploit the hole on b6.} ) 
25...Nxe5 {now that the position is closed on the kingside, this is a more
favorable exchange for Black.} 26.dxe5 Be8 27.Rfd2 Bd7 ( 27...g5 {is what the
aggressive engine recommends. Black in fact has a structure similar to a Dutch
Stonewall, with the potential for a well-supported pawn advance on the
kingside.} ) 28.Bd3 Qf8 ( 28...Bc5 {looks good, hitting the e3 pawn, but Black
has different ideas in mind for his bishops.} ) 29.Rc2 {inviting Black's next
move.} 29...Ba4 30.b3 Bb5 31.Qf3 Bb4 {this sets off a sequence of complex
exchanges.} ( 31...Bxd3 32.Rxd3 b5 {followed by ...Bb4 gives Black a small plus
here, according to Houdini.} ) 32.Nxb5 Rxc2 33.Bxb4 Qxb4 34.Nd6 Kh7 35.h3 
{neither side it seems wants to resolve the question of which Black rook will be
taken.} 35...Rc1 36.Nxc8 {finally!} 36...Rxc8 {after the dust settles, Houdini
considers the position as equal. With only the c-file open and more or less
equivalent minor pieces, that seems reasonable.} 37.g4 hxg4 38.hxg4 {White has
opened the h-file, which he perhaps has a better chance to exploit, as well as
clearing some more light squares for his bishop.} 38...Qa3 39.Qe2 Kg8 40.Kg2 
Rc1 41.Rd2 Qc5 42.Rc2 {deciding to force the exchange.} 42...Rxc2 43.Bxc2 
{again, full equality.} 43...Kf7 44.Kg3 d4 45.gxf5 gxf5 46.e4 d3 47.Qxd3 Qg1+ 
48.Kf3 Qh1+ 49.Ke3 Qg1+ 50.Kd2 Qf2+ 51.Kd1 Qg1+ 52.Kd2 Qf2+ 53.Kc3 Qxf4 {a long
dance to maintain equality.} 54.Qd7+ Kg8 55.Qc8+ Kh7 56.Qxb7 Qxe5+ 57.Kc4 Qb2 
58.Bd3 Qc1+ 59.Kd4 Qg1+ 60.Kc3 Qa1+ 61.Kb4 a5+ 62.Kc5 ( 62.Kxa5 $2 Qc3+ {picks
up the bishop.} ) 62...e5 ( 62...Qc3+ {would have continued the dance.} ) 
63.Qd5 f4 {Black appears to be trying for a win - otherwise he could have
continued the previous sequence of checks - but his queen is somewhat misplaced
and his knight is out of the action, leaving White with good counterplay.} 
64.Kd6 Qxa2 ( 64...f3 $5 ) 65.Bc4 Qa3+ 66.Kxe5 {Houdini considers this equal,
but it looks a lot easier to play as White here.} 66...Qe7+ {what should be the
losing move, according to Houdini. White now picks up the f-pawn, but is
subjected to a series of checks.} ( 66...f3 ) ( 66...Qf8 ) 67.Kxf4 Qh4+ 68.Ke3 
Qe1+ 69.Kd4 ( 69.Kf3 {would eventually allow White's king to run to the
queenside and block the checks, keeping the extra pawn.} 69...Qh1+ 70.Kf2 Qh4+ 
71.Ke2 Qg4+ 72.Kd2 Qf4+ 73.Kc2 Qf2+ 74.Kc3 Qe1+ 75.Qd2 ) 69...Qg1+ 70.Ke5 Qg3+ 
71.Kf6 {now Black regains the pawn after another series of checks.} 71...Qf4+ 
72.Ke7 Qc7+ 73.Qd7 Qe5+ 74.Kf8 Qb8+ 75.Ke7 Qe5+ 76.Be6 Qxe4 $11 77.Qd5 Qb4+ ( 
77...Qxd5 78.Bxd5 Nf5+ {is an excellent drawing idea. White cannot stop Black
from eliminating his last pawn, for example} 79.Kd7 Nd4 80.Kd6 Nxb3 ) 78.Kf6 
Qh4+ 79.Kf7 Qf4+ 80.Ke7 Qb4+ 81.Kd7 Nxe6 82.Kxe6 {Black, after playing a long
and what must have been exhausting game, now lets it slip away quickly, showing
how difficult queen endings can be.} 82...Kh6 ( 82...Qe1+ ) 83.Kd7 {White
screens himself from further checks, giving himself the initiative.} 83...Kg7 
{this now allows White to gang up with both king and queen on the Black king and
then force an exchange of queens, with a winning K+P ending.} ( 83...a4 84.Qc6+ 
Kh5 85.bxa4 {looks good for White as well.} ) 84.Qe5+ Kf7 {one continuation
would be Qe6+, Kf8, Qe8+, Kg7 and then Qe7+} 1-0
