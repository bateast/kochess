1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Qb3 {this move does not have independent
significance versus Qc2 if Black takes on c4, as is most common in the database,
but would make a difference on other moves, for example ...e6 or ...Qb6.} 
4...dxc4 {opening theory now calls this a Queen's Gambit Accepted, but this
continuation is certainly consistent with the ideas behind the Slav Defense.} 
5.Qxc4 Bf5 {developing the bishop on its most effective diagonal.} 6.g3 {this is
by far the most common approach, with Nc3 the next choice. However as a Slav
player, I am always fine with my opponent developing on the long diagonal, since
the b7/c6 chain helps blunt the bishop.} 6...e6 {advancing now that the
light-square bishop is developed.} 7.Bg2 Be7 ( 7...Nbd7 {is played more often
here, retaining a bit of flexibility with the bishop, but lines often transpose
after a future ...Be7, or vice versa.} ) 8.O-O O-O 9.Qb3 {provoking Black's
next, which has been universally played.} 9...Qb6 {now both sides have to
evaluate the trade-offs involved in trading pieces.} 10.Nbd2 {White is not in a
rush to trade and continues development.} 10...Nbd7 {likewise for Black.} 
11.Nc4 {this is White's only real try for an advantage.} 11...Qxb3 ( 11...Qa6 
{both the engine and the database suggest this is a slightly better option for
Black, however after Bf4 White will have a space advantage, as in the game
continuation.} ) 12.axb3 {the trade-off here is that White gains the open a-file
in return for the doubled b-pawns. Sometimes this can be quite advantageous for
the player with the open file, other times it is less useful.} 12...Be4 {almost
always played here in the database. Black centralizes the bishop and prepares to
exchange more pieces.} 13.Bf4 Bd5 {this may be just a waiting move. Immediately
developing the rook with ...Rfc8 seems more useful.} 14.Rfc1 Rfc8 {Black must
have calculated the following exchange and judged it equal, since White
essentially forces the bishop for knight trade.} 15.Nd6 Bxd6 {otherwise Black
loses another tempo moving the rook and leaves the White knight on a dominating
square.} 16.Bxd6 Ne4 {looking to trade minor pieces again, in reverse.} 17.Ne5 
{this prompts further trades, which simplifies things for Black.} ( 17.Bf4 $5 ) 
17...Nxd6 18.Nxd7 Bxg2 19.Kxg2 f6 {taking away the e5 square and forcing White's
knight to retreat to c5.} 20.Nc5 Kf7 {protecting e6. At this point, with a
double rook and minor piece ending, Black should feel comfortable about
maintaining an equal game. White's knight is better positioned, but there is not
enough material to sufficiently increase the pressure on Black's position.} 
21.e3 Re8 {overprotecting the e-pawn and preparing to go to the 7th rank.} 
22.Rd1 Re7 {further protecting the weakness on b7. It is difficult to see how
White can make progress. She now starts some advances on the kingside, but these
are not actually threatening.} 23.f4 Nb5 {done in order to free up the Ra8 from
protecting the a-pawn.} 24.Kf3 h5 {covering the g4 square.} 25.h3 Rh8 
{preparing to have the rook on an open h-file if the g-pawn advances and is
traded off.} 26.Ne4 {White decides to try something else with the knight and
exchange it off for its counterpart. After this, however, the double rook ending
offers little scope for anything beyond a draw.} 26...Rd7 {more of a waiting
move than anything.} 27.Nc3 {hoping for an exchange, which would un-double the
pawns while still giving White the open a-file. Black smartly declines and
chooses to effectively shut down potential threats.} 27...a6 28.Nxb5 axb5 {this
is the best way to recapture. The open a-file yields White nothing with the
current material on the board.} 29.Ke4 {White attempts to be aggressive.} 
29...Rhd8 30.b4 {dominating c5 and freezing the Black b-pawn.} 30...Re7 {a
waiting move. Black has no real weaknesses and from here to the end of the game
simply has to not lose.} 31.g4 hxg4 32.hxg4 Rh8 33.Rh1 Rxh1 34.Rxh1 {now after
the rook exchange it is even clearer that White has no breakthrough
possibilities.} 34...Re8 35.Ra1 f5+ 36.Kf3 ( 36.gxf5 exf5+ 37.Kxf5 Rxe3 $10 ) 
36...Ke7 37.e4 fxe4+ 38.Kxe4 Kd6 39.Rh1 Ke7 {Black's pawns are fragmented, but
the king and rook cover all the weaknesses.} 40.Ke5 Rd8 41.Ra1 Rd5+ 42.Ke4 Rd7 
43.Ra8 Kd6 ( 43...Kf7 {is more solid.} ) 44.Rg8 Rf7 45.g5 Rd7 46.Re8 Rf7 47.Ra8 
Rd7 48.Rg8 Rf7 {White cannot make progress, so Black just marks time with the
rook.} 49.Re8 Kd7 50.Rh8 Kd6 51.Rg8 Rd7 52.Re8 Rf7 53.Rd8+ Kc7 54.Rh8 Kd6 
55.Rg8 {White admits that there are no winning chances.} 1/2-1/2
