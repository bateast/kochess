1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 d6 3.f4 Nc6 4.Nf3 g6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.O-O Bg7 7.Bc4 {this seems like a
bit of a waste of time in the opening, especially after the next move.
Presumably it was done to preserve the bishop from exchange.} 7...Na5 8.Be2 Nf6 
{this looks like it makes the knight a target for an advance of the e-pawn, but
that would not turn out particularly well for White.} 9.Qe1 {at around 48
percent, this scores better than anything else for White in the database, but
it's still not a good thing. Black has fully equalized already while White
continues to lose time in the opening.} ( 9.e5 dxe5 10.Nxe5 ( 10.fxe5 $6 Ng4 
$17 ) 10...O-O $11 {and Black has a comfortable game.} ) 9...Nc6 10.Bc4 
{inviting a repetition of moves, although Black can do better.} 10...Nd4 ( 
10...O-O $5 {the engine suggests castling first, which looks safer.} 11.d3 Nd4 
) 11.Qh4 $6 {this doesn't work and I'm not sure what White was looking to do
here by offering the c2 pawn as a sacrifice. Even simply castling in response is
fine for Black.} ( 11.Nxd4 {simplest appears best here.} 11...cxd4 12.e5 dxc3 
13.exf6 Qb6+ 14.Rf2 Bxf6 $11 ) 11...b5 {an interesting idea that further
complicates the game and keeps the tension up, which is probably what Xiong
wanted.} ( 11...Nxc2 12.Rb1 Nd4 $17 {and White doesn't have any real threats.
For example} 13.Ng5 $2 ( 13.b3 $17 ) 13...d5 ( 13...e6 {is also sufficient} ) 
14.Nxd5 Nxd5 15.f5 ( 15.Nxh7 $2 {the knight is pinned here and Black now has a
free hand.} 15...Nb6 16.b3 Nxc4 17.bxc4 Bc6 $19 ) 15...Bf6 $19 ) ( 11...O-O 
12.f5 $5 {should be OK for Black, but gives White at least the appearance of
some initiative.} ) 12.Nxd4 cxd4 13.Nxb5 Qb6 {Black has (temporarily) invested a
pawn, but has the initiative in return.} 14.a4 a6 15.a5 Qc6 16.Na3 Nxe4 {now
Black has his pawn back and a favorable position, while White's pieces are
uncoordinated and he lacks an obvious plan to make progress.} 17.d3 Nf6 18.Nb1 
{an excellent illustration of how time in the opening and early middlegame can
be valuable. The knight has journeyed back to its original square, with
associated tempo loss, while Black can now make progress in the center.} ( 
18.Bb3 $5 $15 {would clear the c4 square for the knight instead.} ) 18...d5 
19.Bb3 Qc5 {this avoids having White play Ba4. While d6 seems like a more useful
square for the queen, being less limited, Xiong no doubt had the next knight
maneuver to e3 in mind, which the queen supports.} 20.Re1 Ng4 21.Re2 Ne3 {Black
would be quite happy to have White capture the knight, thereby undoubling the
Black d-pawns and giving him a passed pawn on e3.} 22.h3 {another time-wasting
move.} ( 22.Nd2 $5 {White really needs to get more of his pieces into the game.} 
) 22...O-O {White now has no prospects on the kingside and it's about time to
get the king to safety away from the center.} 23.Qe1 Rab8 {activating the rook;
Black wants to play with all of his pieces. This may seem to ignore White's last
move, which adds pressure to the Ne3, but it still cannot be taken without
benefiting Black.} 24.Ra3 {again a move illustrating how awkward White's
position is.} ( 24.Bxe3 dxe3 {opening up the long diagonal and the d4 square for
the Bg7} 25.Rxe3 $2 Bd4 $19 ) 24...Rfc8 $19 {by this point White is under huge
pressure, which will simply get worse, and can do nothing about it.} 25.Kh1 
{moving off of the g1-a7 diagonal and taking away the ... Bd4 tactic, but it
still doesn't help much.} 25...Bf5 26.Bxe3 dxe3 27.Rxe3 Bxb2 28.Ra2 Bd4 {Black
can again safely ignore White's threat to pick up a pawn, in this case on e7.} 
29.Rf3 ( 29.Rxe7 Bf2 $1 {and now wherever the queen moves, the Re7 will be left
hanging, or White opens himself to back rank problems.} ( 29...Bxd3 {would also
be sufficient, as the Bb3 would be hanging after a recapture on d3} ) 30.Qe2 ( 
30.Qd2 Rxb3 31.cxb3 Qxe7 32.Qxf2 Rc1+ ) 30...Rxb3 {winning the piece, as if} 
31.cxb3 $2 Qc1+ $19 ) 29...h5 {stopping g4 to kick the Bf5} 30.Nd2 {White
finally gets all of his pieces developed, on move 30.} 30...Bc3 31.Qf2 e6 {an
instructive decision. Black heads for the endgame, which he must be confident of
winning, as he will pick up the indefensible a5 pawn in the process.} 32.Qxc5 
Rxc5 {After the exchange of queens Black wins the a-pawn and the game is
practically over.} 33.Nf1 Rxa5 34.Rxa5 Bxa5 {Black has the outside passed
a-pawn, the two bishops, and a well-placed rook, which should (and do) lead him
to victory from this point on.} 35.Kh2 Bc3 36.g3 a5 {passed pawns must be
pushed!} 37.Ne3 {designed to support the g-pawn advance} 37...Rb4 {Black can
also just make a waiting move with the bishop here, such as ...Bg7. This would
remove White's subsequent threat along the third rank with the rook, although it
perhaps doesn't matter in the end.} 38.g4 hxg4 39.hxg4 {Black can now play this
several different ways. The problem for White is that his bishop is trapped
after ...a4} 39...Bxd3 40.Ng2 a4 41.Bxa4 Be4 42.Rxc3 Rxa4 {Black is still
winning comfortably after the end of the sequence - remaining a pawn up, with a
strong bishop vs. knight, and one pawn island versus two. However, those of us
with lesser endgame technique might not have chosen this particular path.} 
43.Ne1 Ra1 44.Re3 Rc1 {the ideal spot for the rook, behind White's isolated
pawn.} 45.Re2 Kf8 {time to bring the king into the game.} 46.Kg3 Ke7 47.g5 Kd6 
48.Kf2 Bf5 49.Nd3 Rh1 50.Ne5 Rh2+ {once the rooks come off, the win becomes more
trivial for Black.} 51.Ke3 $6 {this allows the following tactic} ( 51.Kf3 Rxe2 
52.Kxe2 $19 ) 51...d4+ 52.Kd2 Rxe2+ 53.Kxe2 Kd5 {compared with the above
variation, Black is significantly ahead with the d-pawn and his king position in
the center. Although the f-pawn will fall, this doesn't affect Black's defense
against the White pawns, as Black's king will penetrate.} 54.Kd2 Ke4 55.Nxf7 
Kxf4 56.c3 d3 {White could simply resign at this point, but apparently decides
to play on in the hopes of a blunder by his opponent.} 57.Nd6 e5 58.Nc4 e4 
{Black has two connected passed pawns in the center, will grab the g5 pawn
giving him a third passed pawn, and Black's bishop covers the c8 queening square
for White.} 59.Ne3 Kxg5 {a minor piece exchange is fine for Black, since the
White king can't cover all of the passed pawns.} 60.Ke1 Bg4 61.Nd5 Kf5 62.Kd2 
Ke5 63.Ne7 g5 64.Ke3 Bf3 65.c4 g4 {passed pawns (especially outside ones) must
be pushed!} 66.Ng6+ Kd6 67.Nh4 Kc5 68.Nf5 Kxc4 69.Kd2 {is White playing for
stalemate now? Hardly seems sporting.} 69...Kd5 70.Ke3 Ke6 71.Ng3 Ke5 72.Nf1 
Kf5 {Black's king now runs around the wing to escort his outside passed pawn.} 
73.Ng3+ Kg5 74.Nf1 Kh4 75.Kf2 Kh3 76.Ke3 g3 77.Nd2 g2 78.Kf2 0-1
