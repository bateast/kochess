1.Nf3 c5 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nc3 e5 {Black is not usually this committal on move 3,
preferring to develop with ...g6 and Bg7 or bringing out the other knight.
Christiansen is indicating early that he is looking for an aggressive,
unbalanced response and not a drawish line.} 4.g3 g6 5.Bg2 Bg7 6.a3 {this can be
a prelude to a pawn sacrifice on b4, but this game continues in a more standard
fashion, although the usual pawn push d3 is delayed.} 6...Nge7 7.Rb1 ( 7.b4 
{and now accepting the pawn can be extremely dangerous for Black, for example} 
7...cxb4 8.axb4 Nxb4 9.Ba3 Nec6 10.Nd5 e4 11.Nxb4 exf3 12.Bxf3 Nxb4 13.Bxb4

35.h4 Qf5 36.Ra6+ Kh5 37.Bf7+ Kxh4 38.Rh6+ {1-0 (38) Aguettaz,M
(2443)-Tomazini,Z (2267) Pula 2012} ) 7...O-O 8.O-O a5 9.Ne1 {part of the
standard plan in this position, to reposition the knight with the idea of
supporting the b4 advance.} 9...d6 10.Nc2 a4 {as mentioned during the live
commentary, the idea is to disrupt the b4 advance by taking en passant on b3,
which would prevent White from recapturing with the a3 pawn as normal after an
exchange on b4. White therefore continues by moving the knight on yet again.} 
11.Ne3 Nd4 {the knight looks really strong here and White has no good way to get
rid of it in the near term.} 12.d3 {usually this is played earlier, among other
things to free up the Bc1, which is now blocked by the Ne3.} 12...h6 {this
guards against the typical Bg5 idea White has, with either an awkward pin on the
Ne7 or provoking ...f6 as the result. Although it's a prophylactic move, I'm not
sure it was truly necessary and perhaps Black could have done something more for
his development.} 13.Re1 ( 13.Nxa4 {this pawn snatch doesn't tactically work, as
also pointed out during the live commentary, due to a deflection tactic after} 
13...Nxe2+ 14.Qxe2 Rxa4 ) 13...Qa5 {after White's last move ...Nxe2 no longer
tactically protects the a4 pawn, so Black has to defend it the old-fashioned way
by moving a piece.} 14.Ned5 Nxd5 15.Bxd5 Kh7 {proactively moving off the
diagonal with the pin on the f-pawn.} 16.Be3 {White would be fine with trading
his bishop, which has little scope, for Black's finely posted knight.} 16...Nb3 
17.Ne4 Qb6 18.Nd2 f5 19.Nxb3 {White finally gets rid of the knight in his
territory and saddles Black with defending the isolated b3 pawn.} 19...axb3 
20.Bd2 {White continues his piece maneuvers, getting out of the way of further
Black pawn pushes and allowing his next move.} 20...Bd7 21.e3 {concentrating on
defending the key f4 square.} 21...Rae8 22.Bc3 Re7 ( 22...f4 {would be premature
here, for example} 23.exf4 exf4 24.Rxe8 Rxe8 25.Bxg7 Kxg7 26.Qf3 $14 ) 23.a4 
{Houdini immediately finds this move and likes its dynamic possibilities. This
was a key point in the game, as Ramirez's positional pawn sacrifice completely
changes the dynamics of the game.} 23...Bxa4 24.Ra1 Ra8 25.e4 {again both
Ramirez and Houdini agree on the next aggressive blow, this time in the center.} 
25...f4 26.gxf4 exf4 27.Bxg7 Kxg7 28.Qf3 {see how this idea from the move 22
variation makes a reappearance. Black's pieces on the queenside are temporarily
out of play, as pointed out during the live commentary, while White now has
local superiority on the kingside for an attack.} 28...Re5 29.Qxf4 Rf8 30.Qe3 
Bc6 31.f4 Rh5 {this turns out to bit a bit awkward after White's next move.} ( 
31...Ree8 $5 ) 32.Qg3 $14 Bxd5 33.exd5 Rhf5 {after this, White's rooks open up
with heavy fire on Black's position.} ( 33...Qc7 {is Houdini's move and was also
mentioned during the commentary. Black needs to get the queen back over for
defense.} ) 34.Re6 ( 34.Re7+ {was favored in the live commentary and is also
Houdini's preference for continuing the attack. The idea is to force the rook on
the 8th rank off before playing Ra8. In the game continuation, Black voluntarily
does this, making things easier for White.} 34...R8f7 ( 34...R5f7 35.f5 g5 
36.Re6 Rf6 37.h4 ) 35.Re6 R5f6 36.Ra8 ) 34...R8f6 ( 34...R5f6 ) 35.Ra8 Rxe6 
36.dxe6 Qc7 37.Re8 ( 37.Qh4 {was brought up during the live commentary as the
strongest continuation.} 37...g5 38.Qh5 ) 37...d5 {this loses immediately to the
pawn push, although the tactic is not necessarily obvious.} ( 37...g5 ) 38.e7 
Kf7 39.Rh8 Kxe7 40.Qxg6 {and now Black loses material, with his Rf5 under attack
and the simultaneous White threat of skewering his king and queen along the 7th
rank.} 1-0
