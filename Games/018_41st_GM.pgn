1.c4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.b3 {this keeps the game in English territory, rather than
transposing to the QGD.} 3...Nf6 4.g3 {this would allow Black the ...d4 advance
if desired. In practice, if Black has intended to play a QGD from the start, he
probably will continue with standard moves as in the game.} 4...Be7 5.Bg2 O-O 
6.O-O c5 7.Bb2 {by this point the role reversal is clear, Black is going for a
strong, classical center while White seeks to undermine it from the flanks and
restrain further Black advances.} 7...Nc6 8.e3 {from this innocuous-looking
position, White has scored almost 60 percent.} 8...b6 9.Nc3 dxc4 10.bxc4 Qd3 
{the point of this move is to disrupt White's piece setup, rather than achieve
anything directly for Black.} 11.Ne1 Qd7 12.Qe2 Bb7 13.f4 {White evaluates that
his future strategic chances lie on the kingside, so starts the expanion
process.} 13...Rfd8 {until this point, we have been following the game
Kosten-Hernando Rodrigo (given below) which contains a more normal attacking
plan for White.} ( 13...Na5 14.d3 Bxg2 15.Qxg2 Rfd8 16.g4 Ne8 17.Rd1 Nd6 18.Nf3

39.Bb2 Nb4 40.d7 Nc6 41.Ng5 {1-0 (41) Kosten,A (2516)-Hernando Rodrigo,J (2381)
Castelldefels 2004} ) 14.Rd1 Nb4 15.d3 {the pawn will actually be stronger here,
due to a tactical defense, and cover e4.} 15...Bxg2 16.Nxg2 a6 ( 16...Nxd3 $2 
17.Ne1 {and with the knight pinned and no new defenders coming to its rescue,
the best Black can do is capture on f4 and get two pawns for the piece.} ) 
17.a3 Nc6 18.g4 {White's kingside attack now gets started.} 18...Ne8 19.f5 Nd6 
20.f6 {the start of a deep and unusual sacrificial idea by Kramnik. One wonders
what he would have done in the event of 19...exf5.} 20...Bxf6 21.Rxf6 
{otherwise the previous move makes no sense.} 21...gxf6 22.Nf4 Ne5 23.Nh5 Qe7 
24.Rf1 {here Houdini's evaluation is that White has full compensation for the
material.} 24...Nd7 25.Qg2 ( 25.Qf2 {would be the more obvious follow-up.} ) 
25...h6 26.h4 Kf8 {this appears to be where Black starts going astray with his
defense. Houdini recommends instead looking to start counterplay on the
queenside.} ( 26...b5 ) 27.Qg3 Ke8 28.Qf4 Qf8 $2 {this appears to be a normal
response to the threat against h6, but allows the following combination.} 
29.Nd5 $1 {a very non-obvious move. White's pieces do not appear at first glance
to be sufficiently coordinated for a combination and there are plenty of
defenders. However, the Black king's very limited space and the weaknesses of f6
and g7 are the elements from which the combination is constructed.} 29...exd5 
30.Bxf6 {the immediate threat is Ng7+} 30...Ne5 {to give the king an escape
square on d7} ( 30...Nxf6 31.Nxf6+ Ke7 32.Qe5# ) 31.Qxe5+ Kd7 32.Bg7 {the
combination now morphs from mate threat to trapping Black's queen.} 32...Re8 
33.Nf6+ Kc7 34.Qa1 {the Bg7 is protected tactically by the knight check
discovery White would have after ... Qxg7.} 1-0
