1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 4.a3 {White has many playable options on move four
of the English Four Knights variation. This one is more in the spirit of a
reversed Sicilian, but can also transpose to more standard English positions (as
happens in the game).} 4...g6 {this is a standard English way to develop the
bishop and scores relatively well for Black (around 47 percent).} ( 4...d5 
{would be the way to directly challenge White, in the style of the Open Sicilian
(reversed). However Black only scores 42 percent in this line.} ) 5.d3 Bg7 
6.Bg5 {this isn't found in many high-level games and is an accelerated
development of the dark-square bishop.} 6...h6 7.Bxf6 {consistent, otherwise
White loses time retreating the bishop. The game is now already out of the
database.} 7...Bxf6 8.g3 O-O 9.Bg2 Bg7 {the bishop retreats to protect h6 and
get out of the way of the f-pawn.} 10.O-O {White now has a rather
standard-looking English position, as does Black.} 10...d6 11.Rb1 {White's
typical plan is to use the b-pawn advance to expand on the queenside and push
the Nc6 away, leaving the long diagonal open for White's bishop.} 11...a5 
{Black chooses to (temporarily) challenge the b-pawn advance, rather than move
forward with other development and preparing counterplay on the other wing. The
text move will result in opening the a-file for Black's rook, after the pawn
exchange.} 12.b4 axb4 13.axb4 Be6 14.Nd5 $6 {while it's a key principle of the
English to occupy d5 with a knight when advantageous, it's often difficult to
understand when it is best to do so. Here the knight move is premature, as it
would allow Black to block the long diagonal more effectively.} ( 14.b5 Ne7 
15.Qc2 {is a standard and good approach.} ) 14...Qd7 {with the evident idea of
playing ... Bh3 as a follow-up. This is rather slow, however.} ( 14...Ne7 $5 
{and now} 15.Nxe7+ Qxe7 16.Nd2 c6 17.b5 d5 $15 {is good for Black. For example} 
18.bxc6 bxc6 {and it's clear White has no threats, while Black has a strong
center and better prospects on the queenside as well.} ) 15.Nd2 {this now allows
the bishop to support the Nd5, which is in a strong position.} ( 15.b5 Ne7 
16.Nd2 {would also be fine. If the Nd5 is exchanged, White would have doubled
d-pawns, but the strength of the d5 pawn would be compensation for that.} 
16...Bxd5 17.cxd5 $11 ) 15...Ra2 {not a bad move, but the resulting continuation
is a little awkward for Black.} ( 15...Ra3 {is the rook move preferred by Komodo
8. The difference with the text move is that the rook on a3 controls c3 and
cannot be challenged by a White knight.} ) ( 15...Nd4 {is another possibility.
The knight otherwise is going to be placed rather awkwardly after White's b-pawn
advance. One sample continution:} 16.e3 Bxd5 17.cxd5 Nb5 $11 ) 16.b5 Nd8 
{essentially forced, in order to protect the b7 pawn.} 17.Nb3 {the idea behind
this move is apparently to support an eventual c5 advance. This eventually comes
to fruition, but the knight is nevertheless not optimally placed.} ( 17.Nc3 {is
the obvious move here, hitting the Ra2 and clearing the long diagonal for the
bishop.} ) 17...c6 18.Nb4 ( 18.Nc3 {is also still possible.} ) 18...Ra8 19.bxc6 
bxc6 20.Qd2 {it's sometimes difficult in the English to figure out the best
square for developing the queen. In any case, it's important to get the rooks
connected and maximize the queen's utility. Here the choice is between d2 and
c2. On d2, the queen has open diagonals (c1-h6 and a5-e1) but it's not clear if
they can ever be utilized. On c2, it might better support the queenside and
would leave d2 open for the Nb3.} 20...Bh3 $6 {Black follows up with her
original idea of exchanging the Bg2.} ( 20...f5 {is perhaps more to the point,
getting Black's counterplay on the kingside going sooner.} ) 21.Rfd1 $6 {this
effectively loses a tempo for White.} ( 21.Bxh3 $5 {an English player needs to
know when to exchange the Bg2 like this. While Black's queen always looks
threatening on h3, without the support of a knight or advanced pawns it will be
less effective.} 21...Qxh3 22.c5 {taking advantage of the Nb3's presence} 
22...d5 23.Ra1 $11 ) ( 21.Ra1 {is another alternative, challenging the Ra8.} ) 
21...Bxg2 $15 22.Kxg2 f5 ( 22...Ne6 $5 {would get the knight back in the game,
connect the rooks and again control c5.} ) 23.c5 {evidently this was the idea
behind the positioning of the Nb3.} 23...d5 24.d4 e4 {Black by this point has a
stronger center and more space, so White needs to turn her attention to trying
to contain Black's threats.} 25.f4 {this can be a key defensive move for White
in these position types.} 25...exf3+ 26.exf3 f4 27.g4 ( 27.gxf4 $2 Ne6 28.Nd3 
Qf7 $17 {and White's shattered kingside pawns will not provide an adequate
defense.} ) 27...Ne6 28.Re1 Ra3 $6 {making this rook more active isn't a bad
idea, but again this is not the best square for it on the a-file.} ( 28...Ra4 
{exerts indirect pressure on d4 and can't be chased off by a knight.} ) ( 
28...Rfb8 $5 {gets the other rook into the game effectively and illustrates how
White's opening of the queenside can also be a weakness, with Black's rooks
looking much better placed.} ) 29.Nc2 Raa8 $6 {this makes the maneuver just a
waste of time.} ( 29...Ra4 ) 30.Qd3 ( 30.Na5 $5 {threatening Rb7 is an
interesting idea.} ) 30...Qf7 31.Re2 $11 {at this point White has blunted
Black's initiative and can start manuevering again.} 31...h5 {a good practical
move by Black, as White does not find the best continuation.} 32.h3 $6 {this
sort of defensive move is often instinctual, as it appears more solid than
exchanging on h5. However, in that event White will be the one controlling the
g-file, so it's actually better.} ( 32.gxh5 gxh5 33.Rg1 $11 {followed by Kh1 and
White is fine.} ) 32...hxg4 ( 32...Qf6 $15 {threatening to penetrate on the
kingside, looks more effective.} ) 33.hxg4 Rae8 {this removes Black's
possibility of making threats on the a-file. If Black wants a rook on e8, Rf8-e8
makes more sense, since the f-pawn is already overprotected.} 34.Rbe1 {White
again looks fine, now that Black's threats have dissipated.} 34...Bf6 $6 {this
is too slow and allows White some initiative.} ( 34...Qf6 $5 ) 35.Nb4 {now the
knight is not tied to the d-pawn and can make threats of its own.} 35...Nd8 
{the only way to protect the c-pawn without losing something somewhere else.} 
36.Rxe8 $6 {this is not forced and is a good example of how it is often better
to maintain tension and even increase it, rather than release it prematurely.} 
( 36.Na5 {would be the most challenging for Black, who would then have to find} 
36...Bh4 {to keep things equal.} ) 36...Rxe8 37.Rxe8+ Qxe8 38.Qd2 {at this point
the position looks equal/drawn, so perhaps White simply wanted to head for a
draw earlier.} 38...Ne6 39.Na5 Nxd4 {one of multiple drawing continuations.
White will win the d5 pawn with her queen, but this leaves the back ranks open
for Black's queen to penetrate and give perpetual check.} 40.Naxc6 Nxc6 
41.Qxd5+ Kg7 42.Nxc6 Qe2+ 43.Kg1 Qe1+ 44.Kg2 Qe2+ 45.Kg1 Qe1+ 1/2-1/2
