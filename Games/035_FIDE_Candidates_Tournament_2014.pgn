1.d4 f5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 {an unusual approach, usually this means White is looking
for a solid, unambitious game rather than to challenge Black early on.} 3...b6 
{Black can often fianchetto the light-squared bishop to good effect when given
the opportunity. This also recalls the Bird-Larsen opening as White.} ( 3...e6 
{would be a standard response for Stonewall players and prevents White's next
move.} ) 4.d5 $5 $146 {provocative, to say the least, and a novelty already.
However, the pawn proves to be difficult to deal with effectively.} 4...Bb7 
5.Bc4 {White supports the d-pawn and makes it impossible for Black to try and
exchange it for the e-pawn with ...e6.} 5...c6 {Black therefore looks to
exchange it off with the c-pawn.} 6.Nc3 cxd5 7.Nxd5 e6 8.Nxf6+ Qxf6 9.O-O {both
sides look OK coming out of the initial opening clash. Black's d-pawn on the
half-open file is an excellent target for the opposition, implying that he will
need to push ...d5 at some point.} 9...Bc5 10.Bd2 Nc6 ( 10...Qxb2 {was something
Kramnik was obviously not worried about, since he would obtain good compensation
for the pawn.} 11.Nd4 Qa3 ( 11...Bxd4 $2 12.Rb1 Qa3 13.Bb4 Qa4 14.Qxd4 ) 
12.Qh5+ g6 {and Black's position is full of holes, with his queen offside as
well.} ) 11.Bc3 Qe7 12.a3 a5 {Black's typical reaction, in order to prevent b4.
Although White's immediate idea is foiled, a3 is still useful because it takes
away b4 from a Black piece and ...a5 is relatively more weakening, abandoning
the b5 square.} 13.Qe2 O-O 14.Rad1 d5 {while not exactly forced, this is the
obvious antidote for Black to White's play on the d-file. We now have a
Stonewall pawn structure.} 15.Bb5 Na7 {lacking any good alternative squares, the
knight challenges the bishop.} 16.a4 {a logical follow-up, also indicating White
is not satisfied with a draw, as otherwise a repetition with Bd3 is possible.} 
( 16.Ba6 Bxa6 17.Qxa6 {would be another way to avoid the repetition, without the
possibility of Black changing White's pawn structure with an exchange on b5.} ) 
16...Bd6 {Svidler with this move indicates he prefers to keep his knight on the
board rather than exchange it. This looks a little weird at first, with it
posted at a7, but the knight will eventually have greater freedom than the
light-squared bishop.} ( 16...Nxb5 17.axb5 Bd6 {is an alternative and rather
different way to play, with the two bishops for Black and a White pawn on b5.
Black may be solid, but he has some problems to solve here, especially the Bb7.} 
) 17.Ba6 {White looks to exchange; his light-square bishop is not very useful
either in a Stonewall structure.} 17...Nc6 {there are a number of options here.
Svidler decides to use the tempo to improve his knight's position.} 18.Bxb7 
Qxb7 19.b3 {supports the otherwise lonely a4 pawn and opens up a retreat on the
long diagonal for the bishop.} 19...Qa6 20.Qd2 {White has not changed his mind
about his desire to win vs. draw, so avoids the queen trade.} 20...Rac8 21.Ng5 
Rce8 {Svidler chooses to move the queen's rook twice in order to protect the e6
pawn, rather than take the other rook off the f-file. Counterplay there is
evidently more important to him than on the c-file.} 22.Bb2 h6 {there is no
reason for Black to allow the knight to remain at g5. This is also a useful
preparation for a possible future ...g5, a typical kingside attacking plan in
the Stonewall.} 23.Nf3 Bb4 {Black sees that c4 is a threat. He could have simply
played the bishop to e7 for the same result, but this maneuver helps get him
closer to the time control.} 24.c3 Be7 25.c4 {although the bishop is no longer
hanging on d6, White finds another tactical justification for attacking Black's
central strongpoint.} 25...dxc4 {taking on c4 is best, either now or after an
intermediate move such as ...Bb4, otherwise Black's pawn structure is
compromised.} 26.Rc1 {White takes advantage of another hanging piece, this time
the Nc6.} 26...b5 {this decision to unbalance the queenside structure looks
dangerous.} ( 26...Rc8 {is the solid way to play, suggested by Houdini.} 
27.Rxc4 Qb7 28.Rfc1 Rfd8 ) 27.axb5 Qxb5 28.Rxc4 {White in contrast to the above
variation has significantly greater scope for his pieces and can target Black's
weaker kingside as well as look for play on the c/d files.} 28...Nb4 {this
allows Black to significantly improve the knight and closes the e1-a5 diagonal,
but also cedes control of e5.} 29.Ne5 Nd5 30.Qc2 Bd6 ( 30...Nb4 $5 {harassing
the queen looks like a good intermediate move here.} ) 31.Nc6 Nb6 32.Rd4 $2 
{Kramnik misses the deflection tactic for Black. Easy to do, if one focuses on
the center of the board and assumes that the kingside is safe, without checking
CCT.} ( 32.Nd4 Qe5 33.Nf3 Qb5 34.Rc3 $14 ) 32...Bxh2+ $1 {White has no choice
but to take on h2, leaving the Rf1 unprotected.} 33.Kxh2 Qxf1 $17 34.Qc3 $2 
{although this objectively leads quickly to a lost game, Kramnik must have
decided that a swindle was his only chance to save the game.} ( 34.Nxa5 {was
objectively best, recovering a pawn, but it's hard to picture a super-GM not
being able to convert the material advantage as Black in this position.} ) 
34...Rf6 {blocking any funny business on the long diagonal.} 35.Ne5 Qxf2 
{Svidler is not distracted by White's desperate attempts to generate a threat
and calmly increases his advantage.} 36.Rf4 Qe2 37.Qd4 Nd5 38.Rf3 Rc8 {Black now
goes over to the offensive. The end is near.} 39.Rg3 f4 {Black finally gets to
attack down the f-file. Breakthrough is inevitable and White resigns.} 0-1
