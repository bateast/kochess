1.d4 f5 {The Dutch Defense is an opening that often uses alternative
move-orders, especially to reach a Stonewall formation, as seen in Annotated
Game #147 (a Slav Stonewall). Here Carlsen plays very straightforwardly with the
text move. This may have had a psychological element as well, since the
Leningrad Dutch - something Carlsen had played recently and lost with - is a
more common choice and essentially requires Black to start with ...f5.} 2.g3 
{Anand goes for the standard professional-level approach of a kingside
fianchetto against the Dutch.} 2...Nf6 3.Bg2 e6 4.c4 c6 {a useful illustration
of move-order importance, as White could exchange on d5 with a slight advantage
if ...d5 were played immediately.} 5.Nf3 d5 6.O-O Bd6 {the defining position of
the main line of the Modern Stonewall.} 7.b3 Qe7 8.Ne5 {Bb2 and a4 (preparing
Ba3) are much more popular choices. The text move is the third most often played
and scores well (60 percent) - even better than the other two moves - but this
may reflect the quality of opposition as well. The drawback of White's choice
here is that it does not immediately help his development.} 8...O-O {Carlsen
drew the one previous game he had played in this line, with the alternate choice
of ...b6 (the modern approach to Stonewall development). While the text move is
relatively noncommittal, if Black wants to play ...b6 and continue his
development by getting the light-square bishop out, the earlier the better.} (

{this may look a bit unnatural, but if White's bishop goes to b2, it will need
an unimpeded diagonal to be of any use, so the "natural" square on c3 is not as
good. The knight will also be able to transfer to f3 and support e5 that way.} 
9...a5 {the text move is not a new idea, but it is still far from the main line
ideas. It appears to have been played to good effect recently by other players,
however, so perhaps that also attracted Carlsen to it.} 10.Bb2 ( 10.a4 Na6

(2230) Voronezh 2015} ) 10...Nbd7 {it is more common to have reached this
position by first playing the text move, then a5. The database shows several
games by Moskalenko is this line, for example.} 11.Qc2 a4 $5 {Moskalenko's idea,
to disrupt White's queenside. This goes against traditional ideas of the
Stonewall, which feature play exclusively in the center and kingside. However,
Black can effectively distract White by using this approach and perhaps (as in
this game) later on generate some chances himself on the queenside. Black need
not fear White simply taking the a-pawn, as the pawn is not defensible and the
capture may cause more problems by weakening the queenside structure.} 12.Ndf3

Kiriakov,P (2555)-Moskalenko,V (2540) playchess.com INT 2006} ) 12...Ne4 {this
is a standard, strong Stonewall move. White will have to either awkwardly attack
the knight with f2-f3, or exchange it off, in which case Black gets a freer game
from the exchange of minor pieces.} 13.e3 {this seems like a waiting move on
Anand's part, as it doesn't accomplish much for White.} 13...a3 {the pawn
advance now becomes even more annoying for White.} 14.Bc3 Nxe5 ( 14...g5 $5 {is
an interesting option more in line with standard Stonewall plans for kingside
attacks.} ) 15.Nxe5 Bd7 16.Nxd7 {I'm not sure why Anand chose to exchange pieces
here, since it would seem to favor Black slightly. The centralized Ne5 could
then be exchanged by Black, it is true, but White would then have a strong
central e5 pawn.} ( 16.f3 $5 ) 16...Qxd7 17.c5 Bc7 18.b4 {White with his last
two moves has gained queenside space, which can't be bad, but it's hard to see
any concrete threats as a result of it.} 18...h5 {the engine agrees this is a
strong move, but it's certainly not one a Class player would think of. Its
usefulness becomes more apparent later. Among other things, it eventually may
threaten ...h4 and it also frees up another escape square for the king.} ( 
18...b5 $5 {is something I might be tempted to go with here. For example} 
19.cxb6 Bxb6 20.Rfc1 Rfc8 $11 {White will find it difficult to make any progress
and Black can think about redeploying the bishop via d8 to e7 or f6, as well as
moving the knight to d6 and then onward.} ) 19.Be1 {the piece is doing
absolutely no good where it is, so a better place must be found.} 19...e5 $5 
{Carlsen immediately takes advantage of the relaxing of pressure on e5 and opens
the diagonal for his bishop. Note how effective the a3 pawn becomes as a result
of this.} 20.dxe5 {this is not forced, but otherwise Black can get some useful
pawn play on the e file (occupying e4 after the knight vacates it) or support a
thematic push of the f-pawn.} 20...Bxe5 21.Rd1 Qe6 {moving the queen off the
d-file and the pin, while giving it a better diagonal and potential mobility
along the 6th rank.} 22.f3 {White finally kicks Black's central knight from its
post.} 22...Nf6 23.Bh3 g6 {in this position, it's now evident that having
Black's pawn on h5 helps restrain any ideas of a White break on g4.} 24.e4 {the
logical next step for White in terms of increasing his activity, especially in
terms of pressuring f5. However, the game now becomes more complicated and
Black's open lines are just as good as White's.} 24...dxe4 25.fxe4 Bb2 $1 {this
is a great idea, using an interference tactic to attack the a2 pawn. White,
somewhat surprisingly, has no other way of defending it. The strength of the
Black bishop and the a-pawn is evident. White still has counterchances,
however.} 26.exf5 Qxa2 27.Bf2 {shutting down the discovered check threat.} ( 
27.fxg6 $4 {fails to a discovered check tactic, with the Qc2 hanging.} 
27...Bd4+ ) 27...g5 {an excellent example of cold-blooded defense. Exchanging on
f5 would just give White more lines into Black's king position. The h and g
pawns both look weak, but White cannot exploit them.} 28.Rfe1 Qf7 {time to
redeploy the queen back to an effective square, among other things defending the
7th rank.} 29.Re6 Ng4 {an aggressive choice.} ( 29...Rfe8 ) ( 29...Rae8 ) ( 
29...Nd5 {is also an interesting possibility:} 30.Rg6+ Kh7 {and now} 31.f6 
{doesn't quite work, due to} 31...Qxg6 32.Bf5 Rxf6 33.Bxg6+ Rxg6 $17 {looks good
for Black, for example. It's interesting to compare the tactics in this line
with the main game, since in both cases Black's a-pawn ends up being the
deciding factor.} ) 30.Bxg4 hxg4 31.Rg6+ Kh7 32.Rd7 $4 {a fancy move which does
not work.} ( 32.Re6 $11 ) 32...Qxd7 33.f6 {this looks devastating - or that it
at least could get White a perpetual check - but Black can now return the
material with his own deflection tactic.} 33...Qd1+ $1 {The cleanest.} ( 
33...Bxf6 {may have been what Anand expected, which gives White a drawing line:} 
34.Rxf6+ Kh8 35.Rh6+ Kg8 36.Rg6+ Kh8 ) ( 33...Rxf6 $1 {however also wins:} 
34.Rxf6+ Kg8 35.Rg6+ Kf8 {now there is no longer the Rf8 to block the king and
White has no more checks due to the Bb2 controlling f6.} ) 34.Qxd1 Kxg6 35.Qd3+ 
Kh6 {with White out of checks and unable to further penetrate Black's position,
the passed a-pawn now decides the game.} 36.h4 gxh3 {now White can postpone the
inevitable for a while, but it's only a matter of time before he has to give up
material to prevent the a-pawn from queening.} 0-1
