1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 Nc6 5.Nf3 e5 {breaking the symmetry and
establishing a central pawn presence.} 6.O-O Nge7 {the idea here is not to block
the f-pawn's advance later.} 7.Ne1 {White's idea is to redeploy the knight via
c2. This is slow, but the opening is largely about maneuver rather than attack.} 
7...d6 8.Nc2 {from here the knight can support the b4 advance or move to e3 to
increase domination of the d5 square.} 8...h5 $5 {this move scores well in the
database - although see the next annotation - but is not often played. There is
only one game listed in 2015 with it, for example.} ( 8...Be6 {is the more
conventional choice, along with castling.} ) 9.d3 {both Komodo and the database
indicate that the reaction h4 should be avoided. In the small sample (19) of
games available, it has been played roughly half of the time and scores badly at
25 percent. That said, White appears to be OK in the line, although it allows
some additional attacking ideas for Black, as in the following game:} ( 9.h4 g5 
10.hxg5 h4 11.Ne3 hxg3 12.fxg3 Be6 13.Ncd5 Qd7 14.Nf6+ Bxf6 15.Rxf6 Rg8 16.Nd5 
O-O-O 17.d3 Nf5 18.Rxf5 Bxf5 19.Nf6 Qc7 20.Qf1 Be6 21.Nxg8 Rxg8 22.Bd2 Nd4 
23.Qf2 Bg4 24.Bd5 Nxe2+ 25.Kg2 Nd4 26.Qxf7 Qxf7 27.Bxf7 Bf3+ 28.Kf2 Rh8 29.Re1 
Rh2+ 30.Ke3 Bh1 31.Rxh1 Re2# {0-1 (31) Markos,J (2327)-Navara,D (2433) Pardubice
2000} ) 9...h4 {the most logical follow-up. If Black is going to advance the
h-pawn, she should go all in.} 10.Ne3 {most played here, although the engine
evaluates that first proceeding with standard play centered around the b-file is
fine.} ( 10.a3 a5 11.Rb1 a4 12.Bg5 f6 13.Bd2 h3 14.Bh1 O-O 15.Ne3 {is one
possibility.} ) 10...Be6 {this gets the bishop out, but Black did not need to
develop it this early, as it is doing fine on its original square for now. It
does nothing to impede White's next move.} 11.Ned5 f6 {this seems a little
premature and commital.} ( 11...h3 $5 {is the engine's choice, which would avoid
White's later gxh4.} ) 12.Qe1 {Yu here is signaling a shift in commitment to a
kingside strategy, placing her queen on the e1-h4 diagonal and preparing her
next move.} ( 12.Rb1 $5 {would continue with queenside and central play.} ) 
12...Qd7 13.f4 O-O-O {Melekhina notes the strategic shift and castles on the
opposite wing, making White's threat of expansion on the kingside less urgent.} 
14.fxe5 fxe5 $6 {this looks like a logical and "clean" move visually, but
immediately gives White some advantage to play with, including the open f-file
and the initiative. From here on out, the game gets wilder.} ( 14...Bxd5 $5 
{with the idea of exchanging material and reducing potential White threats.} 
15.Nxd5 Nxe5 16.gxh4 Nxd5 17.Bxd5 f5 $11 ) 15.gxh4 {ugly-looking but effective.
Black has some compensation for the pawn, due to the weak doubled h-pawns, but
White does an admirable job of covering the weaknesses and playing actively.} 
15...Bh3 $2 {it turns out that Black needs to worry more about her white-square
weaknesses, especially on f7, with the absence of this bishop. White has a
number of ways to take advantage of this.} ( 15...Bxd5 {is still a good idea,
but leaves White in better shape compared with the above variation:} 16.Nxd5 
Nxd5 17.Bxd5 Nd4 18.Bg5 $14 ) 16.Bg5 ( 16.Rf7 $1 {and Black has some unsolvable
problems related to the 7th rank and king position, for example} 16...Bxg2 
17.Kxg2 Bh6 18.Bxh6 Rxh6 19.Nxe7+ Nxe7 20.Nd5 Re8 21.Qa5 $18 ) 16...Bxg2 
17.Kxg2 Rdf8 18.h3 {White evidently was concerned about ...Qg4+ here, although
the engine shows that is not necessary.} ( 18.Nxe7+ Nxe7 19.Rxf8+ Rxf8 20.Bxe7 
Qxe7 21.Nd5 $16 {and Black no longer has any real compensation for the pawn.} ) 
18...Nf5 $11 {a good consolidating move by Black. With this and the previous
rook move, she has shut down threats along the f-file. White can also no longer
trade down material, as in the previous variation.} 19.Ne4 {centralizing the
knight and recognizing that the e4 square is superior to b5 for it now.} 
19...Bh6 $6 {continuing with the theme of moving bishops away from controlling
key squares, in this case f6. This time White takes advantage of it better.} ( 
19...Ncd4 ) 20.Nef6 $16 Qe6 21.e4 {White has regained the initiative and revived
the utility of the f-file.} 21...Nxh4+ {a piece sacrifice based on an
interesting tactical idea for Black.} ( 21...Nfd4 $16 {is the safer choice.} ) 
22.Bxh4 Bg5 $2 {unfortunately for Black, this bishop move doesn't work. Yu spots
the refutation, which is not obvious. Two white pieces are hanging (the Bh4 and
the Nf6) and the Bh4 can't move without allowing ... Qxh3. However, White finds
a creative solution by giving back the piece.} ( 22...Bf4 {is the only good
continuation here, with the threat of ...g5 and ... Qxh3.} 23.Rxf4 exf4 24.Nxf4 
Qe5 25.Nxg6 Rhg8 26.Nxg8 Rxg8 27.Kh1 Rxg6 28.Qf2 $16 {still works out fine for
White, however.} ) 23.Nc7 $1 Kxc7 24.Nd5+ {The Nf6 escapes with tempo, thanks to
the sacrifice of its brother.} 24...Kd7 {now Black has problems with hanging
pieces instead and loses at minimum the exchange.} 25.Rxf8 Bxh4 ( 25...Rxf8 
26.Bxg5 $18 ) ( 25...Rxh4 26.Qg3 Rh5 27.Raf1 $18 ) 26.Qf1 ( 26.Rxh8 {might be
simpler, with two rooks vs. queen in a position where the rooks will dominate.} 
26...Bxe1 27.Rxe1 $18 ) 26...Rh5 ( 26...Rxf8 27.Qxf8 Be7 28.Qg7 $18 {and Black
cannot stop the rook transfer to f1 and then f6 or f7.} ) 27.Qf7+ Qxf7 28.Rxf7+ 
Ne7 29.Raf1 {an illustration of the importance of the open f-file in the game,
along with the weak 7th rank. Black's fate is now sealed.} 29...Rh8 30.Rg7 Re8 
31.Rh7 Bg5 32.h4 Bf4 33.Nf6+ 1-0
