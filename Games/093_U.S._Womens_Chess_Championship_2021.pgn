1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 Qb6 6.Bd3 {the Milner-Barry Gambit.} 
6...cxd4 7.O-O {cxd4 is overwhelmingly played in the database, but the text move
is favored by higher-rated players and scores a little better as well (around 50
percent). White gets on with development and gets the king to safety.} 7...Bd7 
( 7...dxc3 8.Nxc3 $14 {here White has three minor pieces developed to Black's
one, good open lines for the bishops, and prospects of getting the queen to
f3/g4/h5 for kingside pressure. Well worth the gambited pawn.} ) 8.Re1 {again we
have a split between the heavily played database move (cxd4) and the text move
favored by master-level players (and the engine). Here the rook overprotects the
e5 pawn, freeing up the Nf3 to move.} 8...Nge7 9.h4 {a typical attacking move in
these types of positions. White has been concentrating on development until now,
but has no need to move the Bc1 given its beautiful scope on the kingside, and
the Nb1 stays at home in case it needs to recapture on c3.} 9...a6 {by playing
this, Black argues that her kingside defense is better off by leaving the pawns
at home and flexible.} ( 9...h6 $5 {this is the most played, based on a small
sample size. Black here chooses to context the g5 square and pay some attention
to kingside defense.} ) 10.h5 {pressing ahead on the kingside. This rules out
...Ng6 and threatens further disruption to the pawn structure.} 10...h6 
{physically blocking further advances of the h-pawn and taking control of g5.} 
11.Qe2 {develops the queen to a square from where she protects the b-pawn, forms
a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal, and reinforces the e-file.} 11...f5 {this
appears to have been done in order to provoke White's next response, which
leaves Black somewhat better off in objective terms. The engine assesses that
White could have exploited the resulting pawn structure weakness with a more
patient approach.} ( 11...dxc3 $5 12.bxc3 $10 {and White's pawn structure looks
fragmented, but the c-pawn does a good job of covering the key b4 and d4
squares.} ( 12.Nxc3 $6 Qb4 $15 ) ) 12.exf6 {for reasons mentioned in the
previous note, here the engine advocates developing the knight to a3 or d2,
which gets it into thae game, as retaking with the pawn on c3 is fine for
White.} 12...gxf6 13.cxd4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Qxd4 15.Be3 {the key moment in this
sequence. Black's queen is exposed and needs to be careful, being faced with
White's centralized bishop pair. Bailing out with ...Qb4 is possible, although
the engine strongly favors ...Qh4, calculating that the queen cannot be trapped.
In practical terms this would be difficult to play, of course. Black instead of
the above chooses to keep her queen centralized, presumably wanting to keep
using it in defense of the king. However, this gives White other opportunities.} 
15...Qe5 $6 16.Nd2 $14 {simple but effective. White now gathers her forces for a
push in the center and kingside, with the pieces cooperating well together.
Meanwhile, Black's forces are disorganized and relatively undeveloped, with the
pawn not enough material compensation for White's positional edge.} 16...Rg8 
{developing the rook to a more effective file.} 17.f4 Qd6 18.Qf2 {forming an
effective dark-square Q+B battery on the diagonal, with Bc5 and Bb6 now a
possibility, and lining the queen up on the f-file against Black's weak f6
pawn.} 18...Rc8 {getting the other rook out to its best file.} 19.Rad1 
{although this lines the rook up against the queen on the d-file, it seems to be
more of a waiting move. Given that her opponent has no obvious plan at this
point, this can be an effective strategic ploy, tempting her to go wrong...as
she does on the next move.} 19...Bc6 $2 {now White has tactics involving the
light-square bishop and a revealed pin on the d-pawn.} ( 19...f5 {is one option
that would maintain the defense by blocking the b1-h7 diagonal and also the
further advance of the f-pawn. Perhaps Black did not like the resulting dark
square weaknesses, but these can be covered well enough by the Bf8. For example} 
20.Nf3 Bg7 $10 ) 20.Bh7 $1 $18 Rg7 21.Ne4 {unleashing multiple threats which
Black cannot parry.} 21...Qc7 22.Bb6 {this is a safe choice for consolidating
the advantage.} ( 22.Nxf6+ Kf7 23.f5 {is a more devastating but complex route.} 
) 22...dxe4 {essentially forced, getting some material back for the queen.} 
23.Bxc7 Rxh7 24.Bd6 Rg7 {getting back to a useful file with potential
counterplay. Black is no doubt hoping that the e-pawn plus more active pieces
gives her a chance to catch her opponent out in a tactic later.} 25.Rc1 {White
will be happy to exchange rooks on the c-file if Black allows it, consolidating
the material advantage.} 25...Nf5 $6 {allowing the exchange of bishops, which
reduces material and removes potential Black counterplay on the dark squares.} 
( 25...f5 $5 {consolidating the pawn structure seems useful here.} ) 26.Bxf8 
Kxf8 27.Rxe4 {taking advantage of the pinned Bc6.} 27...Rd8 28.Rxc6 {correctly
simplifying the position further to a clear win.} 28...bxc6 29.Rxe6 {the
material balance is now queen and pawn for rook and knight, which without
counterplay is a win for White. Black tries a few more desperate moves, but has
no threats left.} 29...Ng3 30.Rxf6+ Ke7 31.Qc5+ {an elegant way to consolidate
the win, effectively using a tactic to trade off rooks.} ( 31.Rg6 {also works,
but lets Black have more fun first.} 31...Rd1+ 32.Kh2 Rxg6 33.hxg6 Nf1+ 34.Kh3 
Kf6 35.Qe2 $18 ) 31...Kxf6 32.Qe5+ Kf7 33.Qc7+ 1-0
