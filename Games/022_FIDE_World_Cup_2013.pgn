1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 {a pawn sacrifice by Black that gets away from the the
standard, heavily analyzed ...Bf5 lines and intends to nullify White's active
play.} 4.dxc5 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.c3 {Bb5 is by far the most popular continuation,
but the text move is second and also trendy. Its function is to immediately
restrain the Black d-pawn and postpone committing the light-squared bishop.} 
6...e6 7.Be3 {White decides to hold on to the c-pawn; b4 would be the
alternative method of doing this. Following is an interestingly unbalanced
example of how Andreikin treated that approach in a high-level game:} ( 7.b4 
Bxf3 8.Qxf3 Nxe5 9.Bb5+ Nc6 10.Bb2 Be7 11.c4 Nf6 12.Nc3 O-O 13.O-O-O d4 14.Bxc6

55.Kh5 {1/2-1/2 (55) Nepomniachtchi,I (2704)-Andreikin,D (2718) Moscow 2012} ) 
7...Bxf3 {the preferred database choice; the main alternative ...Nge7 scores
highly (over 80 percent) for White.} 8.Qxf3 Nge7 {Black with this move favors
solid development and avoids giving White any targets, instead forcing White to
focus on covering his own weaknesses.} ( 8...Nxe5 {is what one would expect here
and is played much more often, but with less success; White scores 62 percent. A
top proponent of the Caro-Kann, Igor Khenkin, prefers the text move, which
continues the spirit of the initial gambit. There are only a handful (4) of
games in the database, of which 3 are Khenkin's, but Black scores an impressive
75 percent in them.} ) 9.Bb5 a6 10.Ba4 Qa5 {a common move in this variation once
Bb5 is played, as it hits the bishop and c5 at the same time.} 11.Qd1 Nf5 12.b4 
{now out of the database with the text move, which is the obvious way to
challenge Black's queen. The only other game to continue this far was a win for
Black:} ( 12.Bd4 Nxd4 13.b4 Nf3+ 14.gxf3 Qc7 15.Qe2 g6 16.f4 Bh6 17.Qg4 O-O 
18.h4 Kh8 19.Nd2 a5 20.Nf3 axb4 21.h5 Rxa4 22.hxg6 fxg6 23.Rxh6 bxc3 24.Nh4 
Nxe5 25.Qg3 Re4+ {0-1 (25) Grekh,A (2355) -Chernyshov,K (2570) Odessa 2007} ) 
12...Nxe3 {see how the theme of using this knight for an in-between move after
the queen is attacked is similar to the game in the previous note.} 13.fxe3 Qc7 
$11 {Black now has a somewhat cramped but solid position, with ideas of
undermining White on the queenside and also targeting the e5 pawn. Meanwhile
White is a pawn up but, with notable weaknesses (especially the e-pawns) and
faces developmental problems for his pieces.} 14.Qd4 {taking advantage of the
pin on the Nc6 to protect the e5 pawn.} 14...Be7 15.Nd2 O-O ( 15...a5 
{immediately is what Houdini recommends instead of castling.} 16.Bxc6+ Qxc6 
17.O-O axb4 {and compared with the game continuation, White would not be in a
position to challenge Black on the a-file.; see the note to move 18.} ) 16.Bxc6 
Qxc6 17.O-O a5 18.Nf3 {White focuses on his own plans and ignores Black's.} ( 
18.a3 {is Houdini's preference, which keeps the a-file closed or contested.} ) 
18...axb4 19.cxb4 Ra3 {excellent use of the a-file by Black, who now dominates
the third rank as well.} 20.h3 {despite being a pawn up, White has no obvious
way to make progress and several weaknesses to cover in his position. He can try
to drum up something on the kingside - he certainly is in no position to play on
the queenside currently, despite the 3-1 majority - but with only one minor
piece on the board, is unlikely to have enough material for an attack.} 20...h6 
21.Kh1 Qa6 {significantly improving his queen placement, doubling pressure on
the a-pawn and seizing the a6-f1 diagonal.} 22.Rf2 Rd3 {Black continues his
active play, seizing the initiative and continuing to make threats.} 23.Qf4 Qa3 
24.Re1 g5 ( 24...Rc3 {is the plan Houdini prefers, with the idea of rounding up
the weak queenside pawns, for example} 25.Rd2 Rc4 26.Rd4 Qxb4 27.Rxc4 dxc4 $17 
) 25.Qg4 Rxe3 {finally regaining the pawn, under very favorable circumstances.} 
26.Ref1 Qd3 27.a4 Qg6 $15 {Black chooses the solid defensive option. Houdini
says he could get away with . ..Re4 to go after the queenside pawns and then
weather the storm, but that would be uncomfortable for a while.} ( 27...Re4 
28.Qh5 Rxb4 29.Qxh6 Qh7 30.Qxh7+ Kxh7 $17 {no doubt Andreikin saw this or a
similar continuation and decided he didn't need to take the risk of having his
king position weakened.} ) 28.Qd4 Qe4 29.Qb2 $6 {White underestimates the danger
on the kingside. This move protects e5 again, but leaves Black's queen in a
threatening position. Perhaps exchanging queens would have been more prudent.} 
29...h5 $17 {Black seizes the opportunity and makes the correctly aggressive
move, threatening to continue with ...g4.} 30.Nd2 {allows the next small tactic
from Black} 30...Rxh3+ 31.Kg1 Qg4 32.Rf3 Rh4 33.Rb3 Qe2 $19 {Houdini evalutes
this as winning for Black.} 34.Qc3 Rg4 ( 34...Kg7 {is the curious-looking move
found by Houdini that advances Black's attack. Black has a deflection tactic
available that would allow him to make some progress.} 35.Rf2 Rh1+ 36.Kxh1 Qxf2 
37.Qe3 Qf5 {is a possible continuation, with ...g4 to follow.} ) 35.Rf2 Qe1+ 
{needing only a draw to advance, Black goes for the repetition.} 36.Rf1 Qe2 
37.Rf2 Qe1+ 1/2-1/2
