1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.g3 d5 {the QGD setup against the English can result in a
number of different kinds of games. Here White is already committed to a
kingside fianchetto, rather than central play.} 4.Bg2 dxc4 {this scores the best
of Black's possibilities here, with around 52 percent for White. Completing the
QGD setup with ...Be7 is the most popular choice, however.} 5.Qa4+ {safely
recovering the pawn} 5...Nbd7 6.Qxc4 a6 7.Qb3 {an anticipatory retreat. White
from here scores close to 60 percent. This is a little more aggressive than the
other major option, Qc2.} 7...c5 {a more classical-type move.} ( 7...Rb8 {is the
better-scoring, more modern alternative. Black gets the rook off the long
diagonal and overprotects b7.} ) 8.d3 ( 8.a4 {immediately would be aimed at
restraining ...b5. White plays this a few moves later, however, as Black prefers
to focus on development rather than taking the opportunity to push the b-pawn in
the interim.} ) 8...Be7 {the bishop often is developed instead to d6 in this
line.} 9.Nc3 O-O 10.a4 Nb6 $146 {White has won the handful of previous games
with this position in the database, so perhaps Black trying something new is
warranted.} ( 10...Qc7 $5 {would pursue more standard development and makes
sense to support the c-pawn, as well as putting another piece in place to
influence the e5 square.} ) 11.O-O Nbd5 12.Ne5 $14 {White sensibly occupies the
now-undefended central square, heading for a more active location for the knight
on c4. This is the point of inflection for the game, as White takes over the
initiative and starts creating threats.} 12...Qc7 13.Nc4 Bd7 14.Nxd5 Nxd5 
15.Bxd5 {an instructive decision to give up the nice-looking bishop on the long
diagonal in order to take advantage of the knight's ability to occupy b6 and
target the weak d5 pawn.} 15...exd5 16.Nb6 Rae8 ( 16...d4 {this positional
exchange sacrifice is recommended by Houdini (!) - not exactly a traditional
materialistic engine choice.} 17.Nxa8 Rxa8 18.Bf4 Qc6 {the point is that White
has now given up her bishop on the long diagonal for nothing - the Nb6 having
disappeared - and Black can try to exploit that weakness. Black also now has a
slight initiative.} 19.Rfe1 Bh3 20.f3 Be6 21.Qc2 Rc8 $14 ) 17.Bf4 Qc6 18.Qxd5 
{an indirect exchange of the Nb6 for the Bd7 - a wise choice. The knight has
done its job, enabling the capture on d5, and the light-square bishop would
become dangerous in this open position without a White counterpart.} 18...Qxb6 
( 18...Qxd5 19.Nxd5 {would leave White with a strong knight on d5 that could
easily be swapped for one of Black's two bishops, negating that potential
advantage.} ) 19.Qxd7 Bf6 ( 19...Qxb2 $2 20.Rab1 Qa2 21.Qxb7 Qxa4 22.Ra1 Qb4 
23.Qxa6 $16 ) 20.Bd6 {another excellent choice, keeping the pressure on Black
and looking to make another indirect exchange, this time of the queens.} 
20...Rd8 {forced, or Black loses the exchange.} 21.Bc7 {also forced.} 21...Rxd7 
22.Bxb6 Re8 23.Rfe1 Bxb2 {Black regains the pawn at the end of the sequence, but
White still has an edge, as Black's queenside pawns are more vulnerable than
White's kingside grouping.} 24.Rab1 ( 24.Ra2 {an alternative choice that places
a rook on the second rank, with the benefit of guarding e2 and remaining fully
mobile.} 24...Bd4 25.Rb1 c4 ( 25...Rc8 26.Rc2 Rc6 27.e3 Bf6 28.Rxc5 Rxd3 
29.Rxc6 bxc6 30.Bd4 Kf8 31.Bxf6 gxf6 32.Rb8+ Kg7 33.Ra8 $16 ) 26.dxc4 Bxb6 
27.Rxb6 $14 ) 24...Ba3 25.Rb3 ( 25.Kf1 {would free up the Re1 from guard duty.} 
) 25...Bb4 26.Rc1 h6 ( 26...a5 {immediately would secure equality, as Black
could win back her c5 pawn immediately if White took it.} 27.Bxc5 Rc7 28.Be3 
Rxc1+ 29.Bxc1 Rxe2 $11 ) 27.e4 a5 {now, however, the e-pawn is protected and the
c5 pawn can be taken.} 28.Bxc5 Rc8 29.Be3 Rdc7 30.Rxc7 Rxc7 31.d4 $14 {the
engine assesses that Black has some compensation for the pawn - White still
needs to activate her rook properly and Black's is definitely better - but not
enough to offset the material advantage.} 31...Rc2 32.d5 {while there is a good
deal of play left, the central pawn steamroller already looks like it spells
doom for Black.} 32...Kf8 33.Rb1 {while Rd3 was also possible to activate the
rook, this move will allow White to challenge on the c-file.} 33...Ra2 34.Rc1 
Rxa4 {Black has again temporarily regained her material equality, but now White
has all the rook activity and can combine that well with her central
steamroller.} ( 34...Bd6 {would put up stronger resistance.} ) 35.e5 $18 Ra3 ( 
35...b5 {moving to preserve the b-pawn does not help, as White can use the extra
tempo to advance the pawn and activate her king decisively.} 36.d6 Ke8 37.Kg2 
Ra3 38.Rc7 Rd3 39.Kf3 $18 ) 36.Rc8+ Ke7 37.Rc7+ {the rook now dominates both the
only open file and the 7th rank. Nimzovich would be proud.} 37...Ke8 38.Rxb7 
Rd3 39.Rb8+ {perhaps played to make the time control, with d6 being too
complicated to calculate immediately.} ( 39.d6 ) 39...Kd7 40.Rb7+ Ke8 ( 
40...Kc8 {challenging the rook appears to give Black more chances.} ) 41.d6 f6 
{the only way to break up White's central duo.} 42.Rxg7 fxe5 43.Re7+ Kf8 
44.Bxh6+ Kg8 45.Rg7+ Kh8 46.Ra7 Rxd6 47.Bg7+ {nicely recovering the second pawn.
Black at this point is just playing on hope.} 47...Kg8 48.Bxe5 Rd5 49.Bc7 Bc3 
50.Kg2 Be1 51.h4 Rd2 52.Bb6 Ra2 53.h5 Bd2 54.g4 a4 55.Bd4 a3 56.g5 {the position
is now completely hopeless. The three connected passed pawns on the kingside
could beat Black's rook if necessary. (...Bxg5 does not work because of Rg7+)} 1-0
