1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 {these days the Advance Variation with e5 is the most
played (and also the most theoretical).} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 
{Spassky introduced this move into top-level play and made it the standard. It
is an aggressive pawn thrust, but it makes perfect sense in the context of the
bishop's location and White's natural orientation to kingside play in this
variation.} 6...h6 7.Nf3 e6 {a rare move, although Anand himself has played
this, along with the main line ...Nd7 and the alternative ...Nf6. The main line
prevents Ne5 by allowing Black to immediately exchange off the knight, so the
game continuation is the natural reaction.} 8.Ne5 Bh7 {no other square is safe
for the bishop.} 9.Bd3 {exchanging off the bishop is the most popular, also
logical from the standpoint of gaining time, as Black's bishop has made more
moves than White's equivalent and White will be left with more pieces developed
afterwards. Other commentators have also pointed out that Black's attempt to
snatch a pawn with ...Qxd4 fails to 10. Nxf7!} 9...Bxd3 10.Qxd3 Nd7 {this knight
needs to be developed sooner or later and challenging Black's Ne5 sooner is
certainly a good idea.} 11.f4 {this is by far the most popular move, although by
no means forced. If White is going to play aggressively with 8. Ne5, then this
continuation makes sense to keep the space advantage on the kingside. With this
move, however, White is essentially committing himself to castle queenside, as
the kingside pawn shield is now almost nonexistent. (See move 14 notes, however,
for a game featuring Anand castling kingside)} 11...Bb4+ {a typical idea in the
Caro-Kann, provoking the c-pawn advance and weakening the future home of the
White king.} 12.c3 Be7 13.Bd2 Ngf6 14.O-O-O {this is an interesting choice. In
the database Anand had previously played Qe2 and won (as shown below). Every
other database game saw the text move played, however. Anand's previous play was
somewhat risky and he probably expected that Carlsen had prepared an
improvement.} ( 14.Qe2 c5 15.dxc5 Qc7 16.b4 O-O 17.O-O a5 18.a3 Nxe5 19.fxe5

15.Ne4 Nxe4 16.Qxe4 Nxe5 {Carlsen plays a new move, according to the database,
trading off the well-placed knight and then centralizing his queen.} ( 16...Nf6

positions.} 17.Qe2 Qd5 18.g4 h5 19.gxh5 Qe4 20.Qf2 Qf5 21.Rdg1 Nxh5 22.Qf3 Rfd8

cannot snatch a pawn, this time with ...Qxa2, because of 19. Bxh6!} 18...f5 {is
Houdini's continuation, which it evaluates as completely equal, although it
certainly makes for some interesting play.} ( 18...Kh7 {is also a good defense
and simpler.} ) 19.Qg6 Qxa2 20.Bxh6 Rf7 21.g4 f4 ) 18...cxd5 19.h5 {this frees
