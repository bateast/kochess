1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 b6 3.g3 c5 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.O-O g6 {Black opts for the double
fianchetto formation rather than entering the Hedgehog proper with ...e6.} 
6.Nc3 Bg7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6 9.Be3 {this move has had significantly more
success than the more standard Rd1. White thereby prevents ...a6 and connects
the rooks earlier.} 9...Nbd7 {the point of the previous move. Black does not
want to obscure his Bb7 by developing to c6.} 10.Rac1 {White gets his rook off
the long diagonal to its most useful square.} 10...O-O 11.Qh4 {the more
aggressive option; Qd2 is the other standard move here.} 11...Qb8 $6 $146 {the
idea is apparently to allow the king's rook to come to c8, but the queen and Ra8
are then placed awkwardly in the corner.} 12.Rfd1 Rc8 13.b3 a6 {Black is now
able to play this thematic move and take away b5 from the Nc3.} ( 13...h5 
{would forestall White's next move.} ) 14.g4 h6 ( 14...e6 $5 {would take
advantage of the placement of the Qb8 defending the pawn on d6.} ) 15.g5 {this
ends up dissipating White's threats on the kingside.} ( 15.Bxh6 Bxh6 16.Qxh6 
Nxg4 17.Qf4 Ngf6 18.Qe3 e6 19.Rd4 Kg7 20.Rcd1 $14 ) 15...hxg5 16.Bxg5 Rc5 
{guarding against Nd5.} 17.b4 Rc7 {although the rook has been chased away, it
will end up guarding e7 and neutralizing the Nd5 threat anyway.} 18.Nd5 Nxd5 
19.cxd5 Nf6 20.Bxf6 Bxf6 21.Ng5 Bxg5 22.Qxg5 Rxc1 23.Rxc1 Qd8 {White is still
better placed to continue to make threats, although Black should be able to
defend.} 24.h4 ( 24.Bh3 $5 ) 24...Rc8 25.Rxc8 Bxc8 ( 25...Qxc8 {simply looks
better. Black can in this line use her queen actively to counter White's
threats. For example} 26.Qxe7 Qc1+ 27.Bf1 Bxd5 28.Qxd6 Be6 29.Qg3 Bxa2 30.Qb8+ 
Kh7 31.Qxb6 Qf4 32.Qxa6 Qg4+ 33.Bg2 Bd5 34.f3 Qd4+ 35.Kf1 Qd1+ {with a
perpetual.} ) 26.h5 Kg7 27.Be4 {activating the bishop.} 27...Qe8 ( 27...Qh8 
{here would again make the queen more active and able to pose threats to White,
even if Black had to stay a pawn down for a while.} 28.hxg6 f6 29.Qc1 Qh4 $11 ) 
28.f4 f5 ( 28...f6 {would take the sting out of White's position, for example} 
29.Qxg6+ ( 29.Qg2 g5 30.Bg6 Qd7 31.fxg5 fxg5 32.Qxg5 Qg4+ 33.Qxg4 Bxg4 34.Kf2 
Kh6 $11 ) 29...Qxg6+ 30.Bxg6 Bg4 $11 ) 29.Bf3 Qf7 30.Kf2 Qf6 31.Kg3 Bd7 32.Kh4 
{White marches the king over to continue the kingside pressure with all of her
remaining pieces.} 32...Be8 33.hxg6 Bb5 $6 {a key weakening move. Black declines
to restore material equality, evidently thinking she can still hold the
position. Leaving White with her advanced passed pawn seems counterintuitive.} 
( 33...Bxg6 34.Bh5 Kf7 $11 ) 34.Kh5 Kg8 $2 {the actual losing move, according to
the engine.} ( 34...Be8 {nothing better than to return to targeting the passed
pawn.} ) 35.Qxf6 exf6 36.Kh6 a5 37.bxa5 bxa5 38.e3 Bc4 39.a3 Bb5 40.Bd1 {Black
has no threats left and White can take her time to consolidate the win.} 
40...Be8 41.Bc2 Bd7 42.g7 {Black is now in zugzwang, as any move she makes will
lead to a loss; she cannot cover the a4-e8 diagonal, f5 pawn and f6 pawn all at
the same time.} 1-0
