4.Bf4 Nf6 5.e3 O-O 6.Rc1 {although this may appear a little premature, leaving
the kingside still undeveloped, it's the second most popular option (after Nf3)
and scores well.} 6...Nbd7 {Black keeps his options open while developing the
knight.} 7.c5 $146 {releasing the central tension is usually favorable to Black
in these types of positions, as the d5 pawn becomes a major strongpoint. The
extra space gained on the queenside is not sufficient compensation.} ( 7.cxd5

version of a Stonewall, supporting the Ne4.} 9.Nf3 c6 {the Stonewall is now
complete. While the position is equal, Black must be happy with his situation,
as he has achieved a favorable version of the opening with White's forces not
deployed very threateningly.} 10.Ne5 Nxe5 11.Bxe5 Bf6 12.Bxf6 Qxf6 {given
White's development scheme, he no longer has the ability to control e5 with a
piece, so Black is able to successfully remedy this standard Stonewall
weakness.} 13.Ne2 e5 14.Qa4 $6 {MVL admitted afterwards that he miscalculated
the strength of Black's responses.} ( 14.O-O $5 ) 14...Qh4 ( 14...Qg6 {is the
engine's choice.} 15.Bxe4 fxe4 16.O-O Bg4 17.Rc2 exd4 18.Qxd4 Rf6 $15 ) 15.g3

h-file, this is insufficient compensation for the material.} 19.Rh1 Nf3 20.Qa5 
{eyeing the c7 square for penetration, although this is not a serious threat to
Black.} 20...Qg5 {Black adjusts with his own queen in response, so she can be
brought back as necessary.} 21.dxe5 Qe7 {much stronger than simply recapturing
immediately with the Nf3, which might have been a Class player's choice. The
queen now covers the 7th rank and pressures c5; meanwhile, the e5 pawn is not
going anywhere.} 22.Nd4 Nxe5 23.b3 $2 {this is simply too slow. Black now takes
advantage of White's exposed king position and awkwardly placed pieces with a
pawn break.} ( 23.Kd2 $5 ) 23...b6 $1 {now White is essentially lost.} 24.cxb6

cannot counter.} 25.Nb5 Bb7 $19 26.bxa7 ( 26.Rhd1 {avoiding the discovered

Black just needs to mop things up, as White is down significant material with a
very exposed king.} 33.a4 Bxb5 34.Kxb5 Qxd4 ( 34...Rxa7 {would end things
quicker, according to the engine. Black picks up the pawn with the deflection
tactic and also forces the indirect exchange of rooks.} 35.Qxa7 Qxc3 36.b4 Qd3+

endgame.} ) 35.Rc7 Rfd8 {continuing to play it safe in the endgame, not going
for any flashy tactics and deep calculation.} 36.Qb6 Rd5+ 37.Ka6 {hoping for a
miscalculation by Black.} 37...Rd6 38.a5 Qd3+ 39.Kb7 Qd5+ 0-1
