1.Nf3 {While this is often the first move of a Reti Opening, it's also a good
way to be noncommital at the start of the game.} 1...Nf6 {Black obviously thinks
the same way.} 2.c4 e6 {this is now technically an English Opening and is
classified as such, even though White eventually plays d4.} 3.b3 {an offbeat but
perfectly fine and successful (57 percent) opening approach.} 3...d5 {Black
decides to adopt a QGD structure, a solid approach.} 4.Bb2 Be7 5.e3 {the double
fianchetto with g3-Bg2 is also popular.} 5...O-O 6.d4 {Nakamura plays this with
the idea of subsequently developing the light-square bishop to d3, rather than
the more conventional e2.} 6...b6 {now Black is going for a QGD-Tartakower
formation by fianchettoing his light-square bishop.} 7.Bd3 Bb7 8.O-O c5 9.Nbd2 
( 9.Qe2 {is an interesting alternative, freeing up d1 for the rook and forming a
battery on the f1-a6 diagonal.} ) ( 9.Nc3 {used to be played more often, but at
top levels not so much recently.} ) 9...Nc6 10.Rc1 Rc8 {interestingly, up until
this point Nakamura is following (intentionally or not) a successful game of his
opponent's (as White) from 2013. Now, as Black, Harika varies from what her
opponent did previously, but she still ends up losing.} ( 10...cxd4 {is
considered equal by the engine.} 11.exd4 Nh5 12.g3 g6 13.Qe2 Nf6 14.Rfd1 a5 
15.a3 Re8 16.Nf1 Bf8 17.Ne3 Bh6 18.Ne5 dxc4 19.Bxc4 Qd6 $2 20.Bb5 Rac8 21.Bxc6 
Bxc6 22.Rxc6 Rxc6 23.Qf3 Bxe3 24.fxe3 Rc2 25.Qxf6 Re7 26.d5 Rxb2 27.Nc4 Qc5 
28.d6 Qh5 29.Nxb2 {1-0 (29) Harika,D (2475)-Khotenashvili,B (2514) Tashkent
2013} ) 11.a3 {taking the b4 square away from the Nc6. Nakamura has an equal
position and appears not to want to hurry with any major plans, but rather see
in what direction his opponent wishes to go.} 11...Re8 {following a similar plan
as in the game cited above.} 12.Re1 Bf8 {this is a logical follow-up and
presumably aimed at defending the kingside, but the bishop is obviously less
active than it could be elsewhere, for example on d6. Unlike the above game
cited with Harika as White, here she never plays the freeing ...g6, which is
necessary to activate the bishop.} 13.dxc5 bxc5 14.cxd5 exd5 15.Qc2 h6 ( 
15...g6 {is possible here, and probably preferable. It blunts the b1-h7 Q+B
battery that White has established, while giving the Bf8 an outlet. Perhaps
Black did not like the looks of opening the long diagonal to White's Bb2.} ) 
16.Qb1 {this prudently removes the queen from the c-file while preserving the
battery on the diagonal. It also serves as another waiting move for Nakamura,
which works to his advantage.} ( 16.Bf5 {is a more conventional approach.} ) 
16...Nd7 {this does not appear strategically consistent with the idea of
maintaining a strong kingside defensive presence.} 17.Bh7+ Kh8 18.Bf5 {the
advantage of this sequence, beyond simply moving to f5 directly, is that Black's
king is slightly more vulnerable and her g-pawn is pinned, creating some
tactical ideas for White.} 18...Rb8 {moving away so the Nd7 is freed from the
pin on the diagonal.} 19.Qa1 {very hypermodern of Nakamura and an idea
associated with the Reti Opening. The queen in the corner exerts pressure on the
center and against Black's king.} 19...Qe7 $6 {one gets the impression that
Black did not know how to proceed in this type of position. White now
immediately takes advantage of this slip.} 20.b4 {threatening to continue with
b5, which would be very awkward for the Nc6. Again the idea is to dominate the
center through indirect means, in this case chasing away a piece defending e5.} 
20...cxb4 21.axb4 a6 {the logical follow-up, preventing b5. However, now White
has other useful things he can do.} 22.Nb3 {the exchanges have given White a
potential strong outpost on c5. Black's d-pawn is also now isolated and White
has the square in front of it (d4) blockaded, making the pawn weak.} 22...Nde5 
( 22...Nb6 $5 {would more directly address Black's d-pawn weakness.} ) 23.Nxe5 
Nxe5 24.Nc5 {after the piece exchange White's position is improved, with the
strong c5 outpost occupied; note also how Black's Bf8 is doing nothing
constructive. Here perhaps Nakamura expected the symmetrical ...Nc4 from Black,
occupying her own outpost and cutting off the c-file. However, Harika goes wrong
with her next move.} 24...Nf3+ $2 {this sacrifice must be either the result of
miscalculation or desperation on Black's part.} 25.gxf3 Qg5+ 26.Bg4 h5 27.Nxb7 
Rxb7 28.Qxa6 {the key move from White's perspective. Black must lose a tempo due
to the threat and White can simplify into a favorable position after making some
counterthreats.} 28...hxg4 ( 28...Rxb4 29.Bc3 Rc4 30.h4 Qxh4 31.Bd7 Rd8 32.Bb5 
$18 ) 29.f4 {another key move for White, keeping the tension of multiple
threats.} ( 29.Qxb7 $4 gxf3+ 30.Kf1 Qg2# ) 29...Qe7 $18 {so White emerges from
the sequence with an extra (passed) pawn and a winning game.} 30.b5 {passed
pawns must be pushed!} 30...Qd7 31.b6 Bb4 32.Red1 Re6 33.Bd4 {note again how
Black's dark-square bishop is not doing anything constructive and how its White
counterpart is helping dominate the game.} 33...Rh6 $2 {this attempt to generate
some threats on the h-file in fact leads to quick victory for White, as the rook
partially blocks an outlet for the cornered Kh8.} ( 33...Bd6 {would allow
resistance for a while longer.} ) 34.Qa8+ Kh7 35.Rc8 Kg6 36.Rg8 Rh7 37.Qc8 
{almost anything wins at this point. A queen exchange would lead to an easy (for
a GM) endgame win, so Nakamura does not mind that possibility.} 37...Qe7 {this
leads to a quicker, merciful end.} ( 37...Qxc8 38.Rxc8 Ba5 39.Ra1 Bxb6 40.Ra6 
f6 41.Rxb6 Rxb6 42.Bxb6 $18 {the extra bishop and Black's doomed d-pawn ensure a
White victory.} ) 38.Qxg4+ {and mate follows.} 1-0
