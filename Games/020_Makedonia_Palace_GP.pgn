1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e5 3.g3 {this is slightly more popular than Nf3, which I play
with the intention of heading for an English Four Knights.} 3...d5 {Black
challenges in the center and plays in the style of a reversed Sicilian.} 4.cxd5 
Nxd5 5.Bg2 {with the extra tempo, White can immediately challenge the central
knight in this reversed Sicilian, which changes the flow of the game.} 5...Nb6 
6.Nf3 Nc6 7.d3 Be7 8.O-O O-O 9.Be3 {a common placement for the bishop in this
line and in some other variations of the English. Bd2 is more passive and also
would block the repositioning of the Nf3.} 9...Be6 10.Rc1 f5 {this is a bit
provocative and there are few high-level games with it. More often played is
...f6, which is solid and scores about 50%.} 11.a3 Bf6 12.Nd2 {this scores 68%
for White in the database. I suspect that Black players have simply not known
how to best handle the position, which is equal but easier to play as White.} 
12...Kh8 ( 12...Be7 {would be difficult to play, given that the bishop had just
moved, but it would effectively combat White's next ideas.} ) 13.b4 {now out of
the database. This simple pawn thrust proves highly effective in gaining White
space and causing Black some annoying problems.} 13...Rb8 {this is an
understandable reaction to the latent threat on the long diagonal from the Bg2.
The rook moves out of the potential pin and protects the b7 pawn, which will
allow the Nc6 to move when attacked without losing the pawn. However, this also
allows White the initiative and a slight plus.} 14.Bc5 $14 Ne7 15.b5 Nbc8 16.a4 
{White continues to play naturally, reinforcing his space gain on the
queenside.} 16...b6 17.Ba3 {White's positional advantage is now obvious to see,
with his bishops crisscrossing the board and Black's pieces relatively awkwardly
placed.} 17...Nd6 18.Rc2 {White chooses to build up on the c-file prior to
making a move in the center. This is prudent but also allows Black to reposition
his pieces to better squares in response.} ( 18.e4 {playing this now is
preferred by Houdini, forcing the issue in the center before Black has a chance
to develop further. For example} 18...f4 19.Nd5 Nxd5 20.exd5 Bf5 21.Qb3 ) 
18...Rc8 19.Qc1 ( 19.Na2 f4 20.Nb4 a5 21.Nc6 {is an interesting alternative.} ) 
19...Qd7 $11 {Houdini considers that Black has equalized here.} 20.Re1 Rfd8 
21.e4 {a complicated position.} 21...Bg5 {since this goes back to f6 after the
next sequence, not sure if it accomplishes much.} 22.Qa1 c5 23.Nf3 Bf6 24.Bb2 
{while Black has gotten ...c5 in, White in the same amount of time has set up a
battery on the a1-h8 diagonal and placed a knight on f3.} 24...Ng6 ( 24...Nf7 
$5 ) 25.h4 h5 $6 {this seems terribly weakening.} ( 25...fxe4 ) 26.Nd5 $16 
{this move is hard to deal with, as it unleashes White's pressure on e5 and the
knight cannot be taken off without losing the pawn.} 26...Nf7 ( 26...Bxd5 
27.exd5 Re8 28.Nxe5 Bxe5 29.Bxe5 Nxe5 30.Rxe5 Rxe5 31.Qxe5 Re8 32.Qb2 ) 27.Qd1 
{eyeing the hanging h5 pawn.} 27...f4 28.Nh2 Bg4 29.Nxg4 hxg4 30.gxf4 Nxh4 
31.f5 Nh6 {Black has managed to retain material equality, but at a high cost.
His kingside is shattered and his minor pieces are very awkwardly placed. The
two knights on the h-file will prove to be a major tactical vulnerability,
especially the Nh4, which has no retreat squares.} 32.f3 gxf3 33.Bxf3 Qf7 ( 
33...Nxf3+ $2 34.Qxf3 {and now the queen can combine well with the other pieces
in an attack against Black's king position. For example} 34...Qf7 35.Bc1 Rd6 
36.Rh2 Be7 37.Kh1 c4 38.dxc4 Rxc4 39.Rg1 $18 ) 34.Bh5 Qg8 {this allows the
following variation that Houdini finds.} ( 34...Qf8 ) 35.Ne3 ( 35.Nxf6 gxf6+ 
36.Kh1 Qb3 37.Rh2 Rxd3 38.Qxb3 Rxb3 39.Bc1 {and Black loses a piece.} ) 
35...Qb3 36.Rd2 c4 {Black appears to be trying this in desperation.} 37.dxc4 
Qb4 38.Nd5 Rxd5 39.cxd5 Bg5 40.Rf2 Rc3 41.Bxc3 Qxc3 42.Rh2 Bf4 43.Qe2 $18 
{further material loss for Black is inevitable.} 1-0
