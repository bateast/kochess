1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.e4 {White breaks the symmetry and lays claim to d5.} 3...d6 
4.g3 Nc6 5.Bg2 g6 6.Nge2 Bg7 7.d3 {the "Iron English" or modern Botvinnik setup
is now reached.} 7...O-O 8.O-O Ne8 {while this is the #2 move in the database,
it scores in an inferior way to both ...a6 and ...Rb8, suggesting that Black
should prioritize getting on with queenside plans, rather than taking the time
to reposition the knight.} 9.Be3 {this contests d4 further, but more importantly
allows for a Q+B battery to be formed on the c1-h diagonal.} 9...Nd4 {the most
popular move. Black would be happy to have the knight exchanged and get a pawn
on d4, which would be a "bone in the throat" for White.} 10.Qd2 ( 10.Bxd4 cxd4 
$17 {with ...e5 now a threat to consolidate Black's central control, along with
moves like ...a5 to restrain White's b-pawn.} ) 10...Nc7 11.f4 {With Black's
natural play being on the queenside, White chooses to expand on the kingside,
which is where her pieces also have more influence. Using the f-pawn as a lever
is one of the key ideas of the "Iron English" setup.} 11...Rb8 12.Nd5 $6 {this
seems premature and Black picks the correct move to exploit it.} 12...Nxe2+ 
13.Qxe2 {the queen is now off of its best diagonal and no longer threatens to
exchange the Bg7 after Bh6.} 13...Ne6 $6 {Black however returns the favor, by
not immediately pressing her natural plan of queenside expansion. This lets
White recover the initiative.} ( 13...b5 ) 14.e5 b5 15.Rad1 {getting the rook
into play is clearly a good idea, but it is difficult to determine which square
is best for it.} ( 15.b4 $5 {is the engine's idea.} 15...cxb4 ( 15...bxc4 
16.dxc4 Nd4 17.Bxd4 cxd4 18.exd6 exd6 19.Qd2 $14 ( 19.Ne7+ Kh8 20.Nc6 Qb6 
21.Qf2 $14 ( 21.Nxb8 $2 d3+ 22.Qf2 Bd4 $19 ) ) ) 16.Bxa7 Rb7 17.Bf2 $14 {and
Black's b-pawn(s) will be weak.} ) 15...Re8 {a relatively passive approach.} ( 
15...Nc7 {challenging White's strong knight seems like a good idea.} ) 16.b3 {a
good but conservative reaction.} ( 16.f5 Nd4 17.Bxd4 cxd4 18.e6 fxe6 19.Nb4 
exf5 20.Nc6 $16 {looks good for White, although Black gets some compensation for
the exchange.} ) 16...b4 $2 {this seems to be a classic strategic error, closing
the side of the board where Black needs to make progress. The extra space is
mostly meaningless.} ( 16...Nd4 $5 ) 17.Qf2 $16 {getting the queen to a more
effective diagonal while also backing the f-pawn, which threatens to advance.
Black is now under significant pressure and has no good options.} 17...Nd4 
18.Bxd4 cxd4 19.Qxd4 {White is distracted from the kingside breakthrough, but at
the cost of a pawn for Black. Note the space advantage and better coordination
of White's pieces as well.} 19...Bg4 20.Rde1 ( 20.Rd2 $5 {looks more flexible,
with the potential of later going to f2.} ) 20...a5 {this attempt at counterplay
is too slow. Black can try to focus on defense instead.} ( 20...Bf5 $5 {would
physically block the f-pawn advance while maintaining pressure on the d-pawn.} 
) 21.Qb2 {looking to reposition the queen to a more effective square again,
while also clearing d4 for the d-pawn's advance.} 21...a4 22.d4 Qa5 23.Qd2 Qa7 
{Black just has some harassing ideas now, rather than real counterplay, and
White is close to winning.} 24.Kh1 {smartly avoiding the d-pawn pin. White is
not in a hurry.} 24...dxe5 $6 {this simply helps White break through and also
control the center, but again there are no good options for Black.} 25.fxe5 
Red8 $6 {as often happens, when under severe pressure a player starts making
worse and worse moves. White correctly identifies the new weakness on e7 and
decisively targets it with her queen, also attacking the hanging Bg4.} 26.Qg5 
$18 Qxd4 27.Re4 ( 27.Nxe7+ {also wins.} 27...Kh8 28.Nc6 h6 29.Qxd8+ Rxd8 
30.Nxd4 Rxd4 31.Rxf7 $18 ) 27...Qb2 28.Rxg4 Qxa2 {a useful illustration of how
pawn snatching on the queenside when your king is under heavy attack is not
worth it. White's attack is now masterful, sacrificing back the material to
break through.} 29.Nxe7+ Kh8 30.Rh4 Rf8 31.Be4 Qe2 32.Nxg6+ fxg6 33.Rxh7+ Kg8 
34.Rxg7+ Kxg7 35.Qxg6+ Kh8 36.Qh7# 1-0
