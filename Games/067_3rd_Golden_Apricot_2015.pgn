1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c6 {instead of following up with the standard QGD moves,
Black heads for a Stonewall by transposition.} 4.e3 Bd6 {typically ... f5 would
be played immediately when transposing to the Stonewall. The text move may try
to tempt White into the c5 advance, which is normally in Black's favor because
it leaves his central d5 outpost unchallenged.} 5.Nc3 f5 6.Bd3 Nf6 {Black has
now reached the standard Modern Stonewall formation.} 7.Bd2 O-O 8.O-O Ne4 {the
overwhelming favorite move in the database. Black follows the typical Stonewall
plan with his knights, seizing the outpost on e4. With White's bishop on d3, the
Nc3 cannot exchange off the Ne4 due to the resulting pawn fork.} 9.c5 {this move
scores only 6 percent (!) in the database out of nine games, illustrating its
strategic weakness.} 9...Bc7 {Black's bishop is no less effective on c7, as its
primary function is exerting pressure on the b8-h2 diagonal.} 10.b4 a6 {there
are several different ways Black could play here. The game continuation is
relatively straightforward, restraining further advance of the b-pawn, then
getting the knight and queen developed.} 11.a4 Nd7 12.b5 {White's plan of rapid
queenside expansion looks like it puts him ahead of Black in development.
White's initiative is only temporary, however, as Black's position holds no
weaknesses despite White's space advantage.} 12...Qf6 {this does multiple things
for Black, including adding support for the idea of the ...e5 break and
positioning the queen well for further action on the kingside.} 13.b6 {this move
is probably unavoidable, according to Komodo 8. Black is threatening to
undermine the queenside pawns with ...e5, so maintaining the tension with the
b-pawn could eventually lead to a collapse of White's extended pawn formation.
However, once the queenside pawns are locked up, then the game becomes
strategically much easier for Black; the only open play is on the kingside,
which is the natural hunting ground for the Stonewall.} 13...Bb8 {the bishop is
still very much in play here, although the Ra8 is now locked to its square. The
problem with the rook will be offset by the inability of White to transfer his
queenside rook, or other needed forces, to the kingside in an effective manner.} 
14.Rc1 e5 {illustrating the classic principle of reacting to a flank advance by
breaking in the center. Note how Black's pieces are activated by this freeing
advance. In addition to the strategic aspects, there is now a tactical threat of
...Nxc3 followed by the pawn fork ...e4.} 15.Ne2 ( 15.Nxe5 {disrupting Black's
formation in the center is the only way to stay relatively equal.} 15...Bxe5 
16.dxe5 Nxe5 17.Bb1 Qe7 18.Be1 Nc4 ( 18...Nxc5 {?} 19.Nxd5 cxd5 20.Qxd5+ ) ) 
15...Nxd2 16.Nxd2 e4 {this is no longer a double attack, but is still a highly
advantageous move. The pawn lever ...f4 is now an obvious future threat. ⩱} 
17.Bb1 Qh6 {hitting h2. A standard follow-up plan for Black would now be ...g5,
coupled with ...Nf6, ...Kh8 and ...Rg8, to get the kingside attack rolling.} 
18.g3 {under pressure, White chooses poorly. Blunting the attack on the b8-h2
diagonal looks like an obvious choice, but now Black can end things much more
quickly. ?} ( 18.h3 {⩱} ) 18...Nf6 {usually, moving a knight to f6 is routine
rather than devastating. Here, however, the light-square weakness on the
kingside means that it can go to g4 and combine with the Qh6 on the attack.
White has no good options to defend against this threat. −⁠+} 19.Kg2 ( 19.h4 
Ng4 20.Rc3 g5 {−⁠+} ) ( 19.f3 Qxe3+ {−⁠+} ) 19...f4 {there's a reason this pawn
advance is a key attacking concept in the Dutch. White's position now falls
apart; Black has a significant preponderance of material participating in the
kingside attack, having with f5-f4 just added the Bc8 to it (removing the
blocking pawn on f5 and hitting h3). Meanwhile, White's pieces are barely in the
game. !} 20.exf4 ( 20.Nxf4 {temporarily staves off defeat, but Black can then
penetrate White's position at his leisure.} 20...Bxf4 21.h4 ( 21.exf4 Qh3+ 
22.Kg1 Ng4 {−⁠+} ) 21...Bb8 22.Qe2 Bg4 23.Qe1 Qh5 24.f3 exf3+ 25.Nxf3 Ne4 {−⁠+} 
) 20...Qh3+ {and the follow-up ...Ng4 cannot be stopped.} 0-1
