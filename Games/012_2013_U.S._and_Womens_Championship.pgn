1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 {this move is of course interchangeable with the more
usual Nc3 given Black's response here. The only independent significance it has
is if Black likes to play the offbeat 3...g6 in the main line Caro Kann, in
which case White then has the pawn push c3 in response.} 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 
5.Nxf6+ gxf6 {venturing the Bronstein-Larsen variation again, as in round 1.} 
6.Nf3 Bg4 7.Be2 e6 8.O-O Rg8 {Black still insists on avoiding the main choice .
..Bd6, but declines to repeat the choice he made in round 1 of ...Qc7. The text
move has the advantage of being more immediately aggressive.} 9.Bf4 Bd6 10.Bg3 
{this is Houdini's preference and a novelty, based on my database.} 10...Bxf3 
{this seems a little premature. White's bishop on f3 is also a very useful
addition to his kingside defenders.} ( 10...Bxg3 11.hxg3 Nd7 $11 ) 11.Bxf3 $14 
{Houdini awards White a slight plus here. White has no significant structural
problems and is ahead in development.} 11...f5 12.Qd2 Bxg3 13.hxg3 {this would
be a weakening move if Black could take advantage of an attack down the h-file,
but this doesn't materialize.} 13...Nd7 14.Rfe1 Qc7 15.d5 {White decides to
immediately attempt to seize the initiative, although a preparatory move might
have been in order.} ( 15.c4 ) ( 15.Rad1 ) 15...cxd5 16.Qxd5 O-O-O 17.Qb3 Kb8 
{Black has staved off White's immediate threats, but White will now have a much
easier time attacking Black's king than vice versa.} 18.a4 Nc5 ( 18...Qb6 $5 ) 
19.Qe3 {White does well to move his queen away from potential threats to
exchange it, placing it on a square that influences the attack on the king via
the g1-a7 diagonal while also eyeing Black's weak kingside.} 19...Rc8 20.a5 $16 
{this takes away the b6 square from black, cramping his defense. Black is under
major pressure and has no counterplay.} 20...Rgd8 21.Ra3 ( 21.b4 $5 ) 21...a6 
22.Rc3 {the game is now increasingly tactical due to White's bringing more
pieces into the attack.} 22...Qe7 ( 22...Qxa5 {does not work because of} 
23.Qf4+ Ka7 ( 23...Qc7 24.Rxc5 Qxf4 25.Rxc8+ Rxc8 26.gxf4 ) 24.b4 ) 23.Qf4+ Qd6 
24.Re5 {White brings his other rook into the attack.} 24...Ne4 {forced.} ( 
24...Ka7 25.Rexc5 Qxf4 ( 25...Rxc5 26.Qxd6 ) 26.gxf4 Rxc5 27.Rxc5 ) 25.Rd3 Qc7 
26.Bxe4 fxe4 27.Rxe4 Rxd3 28.cxd3 Qxf4 29.Rxf4 {White has cashed in his attack
for an extra pawn, but the win is not clear in the ensuing rook endgame.} 
29...f5 30.f3 Rd8 31.Rh4 Rxd3 32.Rxh7 Rb3 33.g4 fxg4 34.fxg4 Ka7 {Houdini flags
this as the losing move.} ( 34...Rb5 ) 35.Rh3 ( 35.g5 Rg3 36.Rg7 Rg4 37.Kf2 
{and White will be able to chase the Black rook away.} ) 35...Rxb2 36.g5 Rc2 
37.g6 Rc8 38.Rf3 Rg8 39.Rf6 Kb8 40.Rxe6 Kc7 41.Kf2 Rf8+ 42.Kg3 {the king can now
march up the board and will eventually force the Black rook away.} 1-0
