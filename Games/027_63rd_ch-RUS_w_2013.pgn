1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.c3 {less challenging than taking on c5, but of course
solid for White. This move is frequently seen at the Class level.} 4...Nc6 
5.Nf3 Bg4 {this is essentially Black's ideal setup out of this variation and the
database statistics show it, as Black scores close to 63 percent.} 6.dxc5 
{Kosintseva has played this frequently, including a prior game against Kosteniuk
from earlier this year in May. Black therefore must have had the expectation
that White would enter this line. The capture is usually made on move 4 when
first possible; this variation can be reached alternatively by White playing the
capture and following up with 6. c3, which however is not the most aggressive
continuation.} 6...a6 $146 {a novelty on move 6! However, perhaps not so unusual
when it's one of Houdini's top choices. The move also appears in their previous
game, at a later point. Here it helps restrain the idea of White pushing the
b-pawn.} ( 6...e6 {is what Kosteniuk played before and is most common.} 7.b4

Bxf3 {this "little tactic" was of course foreseen by White. In other lines with
an earlier dxc5, White may try to hang on to the extra pawn. Here white cedes
the e5 pawn, but in exchange gets the two bishops.} 8.Qxf3 Nxe5 9.Qd1 {White
evidently wants to keep her options open regarding future placement of the
queen.} 9...e6 10.Be2 Ne7 {in this French-type structure, the knight development
with Ne7-f5 is both common and effective.} 11.b4 {reinforcing c5 and untying the
Be3 from the pawn's defense.} 11...Nf5 12.Bf4 Nc6 {by this point Black has
comfortable equality, with a dynamic balance between the minor pieces and pawn
structures. Black's position looks more natural to play, although there is no
real advantage.} 13.O-O g6 ( 13...Be7 {is also possible, with the idea of
exchanging off the Bf4.} ) 14.Bd3 {the bishop was accomplishing nothing on its
previous diagonal and has limited scope, given Black's pawn structure, so now it
is going to exchange itself off.} 14...Bg7 15.Bxf5 gxf5 {this looks like a
strange line for Black to enter, but a similar structure can occur, for example,
in the Caro-Kann Exchange Variation. Black argues that the possibility of using
the open g-file and stronger central pawn structure outweigh the weakening of
the kingside.} 16.Bd6 a5 ( 16...Bf8 {is Houdini's preference, seeking to
exchange the Bd6 or drive it away.} ) ( 16...Nxb4 17.Re1 Qd7 {is an interesting
possibility; the c3 pawn cannot capture, as it is pinned to the Ra1. Black
cannot hold onto the pawn (the d5 pawn can be captured once the knight moves,
due to the pin on the e6 pawn), but it would be another way to disrupt White's
queenside pawns. Play could continue} 18.a4 Rg8 19.g3 a5 20.Ra3 Na6 21.Qxd5 
O-O-O $5 ) 17.bxa5 {this seems to be exactly what Black wanted.} ( 17.b5 {it is
unclear to me why White would not prefer this to the text move, as it mobilizes
the queenside pawn majority to good effect.} ) 17...Rxa5 18.Nd2 {evidently
heading for b3 to help protect c5. White offers the c3 pawn in the process.} 
18...Qd7 ( 18...Bxc3 {leads to complicated play.} 19.Rb1 b5 20.a3 ( 20.cxb6 
Qxd6 21.Nc4 Qc5 22.Nxa5 Qxa5 23.a4 $15 ) 20...Qa8 {and Houdini evaluates this as
equal, but there is a lot going on for both sides here.} ) 19.Nb3 Ra4 {a
master-level move, keeping the rook advanced and mobile along the open fourth
rank.} 20.Nd2 Ra3 21.Rb1 Be5 {Black finally decides to exchange off the bishop.} 
22.Bxe5 Nxe5 23.Re1 Ng6 ( 23...Nd3 24.Re3 Nxc5 25.Nb3 Nxb3 26.axb3 O-O {is
evaluated as equal by the engine.} ) 24.Qc1 {perhaps with the idea of exploiting
the c1-h6 diagonal, although this does not happen in the game.} ( 24.Nf3 $5 ) 
24...Rxa2 {Black now decides to take one of the pawns offered to her.} 25.Nf3 
O-O 26.h4 f6 $6 {this covers g5 and e5, but weakens e6 at the same time.} ( 
26...Qc7 {instead seizes a key diagonal and allows Black to make some threats.} 
) 27.Rb6 {White fails here to put Black under maximum pressure, allowing her to
strengthen the center.} ( 27.h5 {would be the most testing move.} 27...Ne7 
28.Rb6 Nc6 29.Nd4 Re8 30.Qb1 Ra7 31.h6 ) 27...e5 {although the earlier ...f6 may
not have been fully accurate, the text move is now possible.} 28.Qb1 Ra7 29.Rd6 
Qc8 30.Rxd5 Ne7 31.Rd6 Qxc5 {the position has simplified now and is equal, with
Black's small material plus offset by the weaker pawn structure (3 pawn islands
versus 2) and White's piece activity.} 32.Qb3+ Kh8 ( 32...Kg7 $2 33.Rd7 ) 
33.Rd7 Ng6 34.Qe6 b5 {going for further simplification, at the cost of one of
Black's doubled pawns.} 35.Rxa7 Qxa7 36.Qxf5 Qg7 ( 36...Qf7 {would neutralize a
possible h5 push.} 37.h5 Nf4 38.Re4 Nxh5 39.Rh4 Nf4 40.Nxe5 fxe5 41.Rxh7+ Qxh7 
42.Qxf8+ Qg8 {and White takes a perpetual check.} ) 37.Rd1 ( 37.h5 {again would
challenge Black most effectively.} ) 37...Nf4 38.g3 Ne2+ 39.Kg2 Qg6 40.Qxg6 
hxg6 {Houdini considers this an equal endgame, although Black has a small
advantage based on her knight's activity.} 41.Rd7 Nxc3 42.Rb7 ( 42.Rc7 Ne4 
43.Rb7 ) 42...Kg8 ( 42...Rd8 $5 ) 43.g4 {White seems to be overpressing on the
kingside and creating potential weaknesses.} 43...Rd8 44.h5 g5 45.Nh2 $6 {this
appears to needlessly let Black's rook onto the fourth rank.} ( 45.Rb6 )

knight and rook combine to penetrate the kingside, for example} 48.Kg2 Nf4+

White's intent was here.} ( 55.Rxb5 Rxh5 56.Rb8+ Kf7 57.Rb7+ Kg6 58.Ne7+ Kf7

57...Re3 58.Kf2 Re4 59.Nxb5 Rb4 60.Rh7 Rxb5 61.Rxh6 Kg7 {unlike in the move 57
variation, White's rook now cannot attack Black's pawns and king from the side,
making the defense impossible.} 62.Rh4 f5 63.Kg3 Kg6 64.Rh8 Rb3+ 65.Kg2 Kg5 0-1
