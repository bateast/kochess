1.c4 e6 2.g3 d5 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Bg2 a6 {this is not one of those types of positions
where ...a6 will be inevitably played at some point, so throwing it in this
early appears artificial. White scores a healthy 60 percent from this position.} 
5.d4 {transposing to a Catalan where Black's previous move definitely looks
strange. However, the point is that White cannot automatically regain the pawn
after the capture on c4, as ...b5 is now possible.} 5...dxc4 6.O-O {it's
sometimes hard to remember that the Queen's Gambit is actually a gambit, but now
White is playing it as such.} 6...Nc6 7.Nbd2 {not the most promising-looking
move. Top players normally play e3 or Bg5.} 7...Nxd4 {although by no means
obligatory, this has been played in all 8 database games.} 8.Nxc4 {White has
indirectly exchanged the d and c pawns.} 8...Bc5 {Black plays to maintain the
central knight, rather than trade it off.} 9.Nfe5 {White in turn also foregoes
exchanging the Nd4, preferring to establish her own knight in the center.} 
9...O-O 10.Be3 {developing a piece and maintaining pressure in the center,
temporarily pinning the knight against the hanging Bc5. Interestingly, Houdini
already gives a small plus to White, meaning she has more than enough
compensation for the pawn.} 10...Ba7 {protecting the bishop in the best way,
although it still looks awkward.} 11.Rc1 $14 {What does White have for the pawn?
The Ne5 is excellently placed and cannot be easily driven off. The Nc4 is also
strong and can be routed to c6 if Black plays ...b5. White's Bg2 also looks
excellent, while its counterpart is doing nothing on c8 and will be a pain to
develop. Finally, the half-open c-file is already occupied by a White rook.} 
11...c5 {Black attempts to play as actively as possible and supports the d4
outpost.} 12.Bd2 {White judges that the bishop has no future on the g1-a7
diagonal and prepares to reroute it. This also clears the square for the e-pawn
to kick the Nd4.} 12...Nd5 {besides centralizing the knight, this blocks the
long diagonal and potentially will assist Black in developing the queenside.} 
13.e3 Nb5 14.Qe2 {while this develops the queen to a useful square, the main
effect is to clear d1 to develop the other rook.} 14...Nd6 {Black looks to start
some exchanges, in the hopes of trading away White's advantages.} 15.Rfd1 Nxc4 
16.Nxc4 ( 16.Qxc4 {would give Black easier play.} 16...Qc7 17.Nf3 b5 18.Qh4 f6 
$11 ) 16...b5 17.Ba5 ( 17.e4 {immediately is also possible.} 17...bxc4 18.exd5 
exd5 19.Bc3 {and although now down two pawns, White still has the upper hand.} 
19...Be6 20.Bxd5 Bxd5 21.Qe5 f6 22.Qf5 g6 23.Qxd5+ Qxd5 24.Rxd5 $14 ) 17...Qe7 
18.e4 {White must continue to play actively.} ( 18.Ne5 $6 Bb7 {and now Black has
a freer game and the material advantage will start playing more of a role.} ) 
18...Nb4 {a committal move on the queenside. White can now transform Black's
pawn structure there to something much less effective, while continuing her
central play.} ( 18...Nf6 $5 ) 19.Bxb4 cxb4 20.Ne5 ( 20.e5 Bb7 21.Bxb7 Qxb7 
22.Na5 {is Houdini's preferred continuation. White's pawn on e5 is strong and
cramps Black, while her rooks look excellent and the knight is prepared to hop
into c6.} ) 20...Qg5 ( 20...Bb7 {it seems like finally getting this piece into
the game would be a good idea.} ) 21.Nc6 e5 {a useful move for Black that would
have been prevented by an earlier e5 on White's part.} 22.h4 {White pre-empts
potential activity by Black on the kingside and kicks the queen.} 22...Qf6 
23.b3 {White decides not to rush with the pawn capture on b4 (and in fact never
plays it).} 23...a5 $6 {playing a pawn move here essentially gives White a free
tempo and shows too great an attachment to the b4 pawn. The b5 pawn is immune to
capture because of the threat to f2, but White can immediately remedy that.} ( 
23...Be6 $11 ) 24.Rc2 Bb7 $2 {ironically the bishop finally develops, and it's
the losing move.} 25.Nxa7 Rxa7 26.Rc7 {the pin against the Ra7 and the fact that
the Bb7 is otherwise unprotected mean that White now has too many unanswerable
threats.} 26...Qb6 {this attempts to remedy the pin situation, but White can
powerfully double rooks on the 7th rank and Black cannot do anything about it.} 
27.Rdd7 a4 {Black attempts to distract White with this queenside sortie, but to
no avail.} 28.Kh2 {White puts safety first, getting the king out of the f-pawn
pin and off the back rank.} 28...h6 29.Qe3 Qa6 30.Qc5 {the queen now enters with
decisive threats.} 30...axb3 {again, more desperately, attempting to distract
White.} 31.Qxf8+ {and it's mate in 3 (or 1, if Kxf8).} 1-0
