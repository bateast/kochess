1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.d3 {this gives the move order with an early Nf3 an
independent significance. Otherwise, Nc3 is a transposition to the Two Knights
variation and e5 can result in an Advance variation, for example.} 3...g6 {this
is the third most popular choice in the database. Black chooses not to fight
directly in the center, either by exchanging on e4 or with ...Bg4.} 4.e5 
{gaining space and eliminating the opportunity for Black to exchange central
pawns.} 4...Bg7 5.Bf4 {in some gambit-type openings, this type of setup to
protect the pawn with the bishop might be necessary and the extra material would
help compensate for the awkward piece placement. Here, the more simple d4 seems
indicated, even though it's a double move for the pawn in the opening.} 5...Qb6 
{a natural reaction to the early sortie of the White bishop, targeting b2 and
developing the queen to a nice square, pressuring on the g1-a7 diagonal.} 
6.Nbd2 {offering the "poisoned" b2 pawn, as its capture would not be bad for
White.} 6...Nh6 $6 {this is just an awkward placement for the knight. Komodo
Dragon suggests ...Nd7 and ...Bh6 as alternatives. In the latter case, an
exchange on h6 would remove one of White's developed pieces.} ( 6...Qxb2 7.d4 
Bh6 8.Rb1 Qxa2 9.Ng5 $14 {White has more than enough compensation for the pawns
in terms of a lead in development and open lines. Black will also have trouble
with developing pieces to useful squares.} ) 7.Nb3 $14 {choosing to put the
knight on a better square and block the b-file, protecting the b-pawn.} 7...Bg4 
{in this structure, the light-square bishop is hemmed in by its own pawns, so
exchanging it for the Nf3 is good strategy.} ( 7...a5 {looking to chase the Nb3
is a possibility as well. We'll see this idea recur later.} ) 8.h3 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 
Nd7 {Black again passes up the idea of ...a5 in favor of piece development.} 
10.d4 {White consolidates the center, supporting e5 and also fighting for
control of c5.} 10...e6 {solid but a little passive. One thing to note is that
now the idea of the ...c5 break is eventually possible, with the d5 pawn
protected.} ( 10...a5 $5 {the engines like this idea here, which helps fight for
c5 if White allows Black to chase away the Nb3, or weakens White's queenside if
the a-pawn goes to a4 to block Black's advance.} ) 11.g4 {now that the center is
locked, this kind of thrust on the wing is strategically sound.} ( 11.Bd3 $5 
{is a less commital alternative, developing a piece and keeping White's options
open.} ) 11...Ng8 {correctly retreating the knight, but also highlighting its
lack of utility from the start on h6.} 12.h4 {with the knight now out of the
way, White lacks good targets for the pawn advance, so developing a piece might
have been more useful.} 12...f6 {a thematic pawn break, also seen in French
Defense type positions. Black's pressure challenges the head of White's pawn
chain on e5. It also reactivates the Bg7. At the same time, e6 is weakened and
the f-file will soon be opened.} 13.O-O-O ( 13.exf6 Ngxf6 $11 14.h5 ( 14.g5 Ne4 
) 14...a5 ) 13...fxe5 14.dxe5 c5 $6 ( 14...Ne7 {instead gets the knight to a
useful square and allows the rook to go to f8.} ) ( 14...Bxe5 $2 {...Nxe5 has
similar problems} 15.Bxe5 Nxe5 16.Qe2 $18 {the queen's pressure down the e-file
can't be countered - if ...Qc7, then Re1 - so the e-pawn will fall.} ) 15.h5 
{White now presses the advantage on the kingside, where Black cannot afford to
open additional lines to the king.} 15...O-O-O {this gets the king out of the
way, but allows White a dominating space advantage.} ( 15...Nh6 {ironically
seems better, by physically preventing the h-pawn advance, although a human
player probably would not consider moving the piece back after such a
humiliating sequence.} ) 16.h6 $18 Bf8 17.c4 d4 ( 17...dxc4 $2 18.Bxc4 $18 {and
White's last piece gets developed to an outstanding square.} ) 18.Bg2 {the Q+B
battery on the long diagonal, threatening b7, looks menacing but is not yet a
knockout.} 18...Be7 {this clears the square for the rook, but also blocks the
knight from developing.} 19.Kb1 {this doesn't appear necessary, but perhaps
White wanted to see what her opponent would do next.} 19...Rf8 {without much to
do on the d-file, the rook swings over to the f-file.} 20.Qe4 {maintaining the
Q+B battery but limiting the queen's potential scope.} ( 20.Qg3 $5 {would
overprotect the e5 pawn and guard f2, while leaving the queen a bit freer.} )
