1.Nf3 d5 2.d4 Nf6 3.g3 {an uncommon continuation with some transpositional
possibilities.} 3...c6 {Black chooses a Slav setup, which immediately aims to
nullify White's pending bishop development to g2.} 4.Bg2 Bf5 5.O-O Nbd7 6.c4 
{we now have a fianchetto-type Slav, which is not nearly as effective an opening
for White as the analagous Catalan against the QGD (without ...c6 being played)} 
6...e6 7.Qb3 {an aggressive move, but one which scores over 56 percent for Black
in the database. All of the main continuations favor Black, showing how the
fianchetto line versus the Slav is generally ineffective.} 7...Qc8 {a rather
passive development for the queen.} ( 7...Qb6 {is the most popular and should be
the easiest road to equality. Exchanging queens on b6 would be fine for Black,
as he then would get the half-open a-file and the doubled b-pawns are not in
fact weak.} ) 8.Nc3 dxc4 {a novelty in the database. Black normally continues to
maintain the tension in the center and have the extra control over e4. The text
move leads to a looser continuation by Black which is more aggressive and
unbalanced.} ( 8...h6 {is the most played here.} ) 9.Qxc4 b5 10.Qb3 b4 {the
logical follow-up. Now that Black has chosen this aggressive line which also
weakens his queenside, he needs to keep hitting White's pieces to disrupt his
opponent and keep him off-balance.} 11.Na4 ( 11.Nb1 {is an alternative, looking
to reposition the knight to d2.} ) 11...Be4 12.Bd2 {White plays carefully to
neutralize Black's chances.} ( 12.Bg5 $5 Bd5 13.Qd3 Be4 14.Qe3 {would see White
play for an advantage and avoid the repetition line from the game.} ) 12...Bd5 
13.Qc2 Qa6 {by attacking the Na4 and the e2 pawn simultaneously, Black sets up
the conditions for the repetition. The White queen must stay on the d1-a4
diagonal to protect the knight and White also has to worry about the pawn.} 
14.Rfe1 Be4 15.Qb3 {White accepts the idea of a draw by repetition.} ( 15.Qd1 
{would avoid this, but the position is equal in any case.} ) 15...Bd5 16.Qc2 
Be4 17.Qb3 Bd5 18.Qc2 Be4 1/2-1/2
