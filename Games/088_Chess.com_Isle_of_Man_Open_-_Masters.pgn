out of reversed Sicilian territory. Nf3 is the most played in the database.}

{the bishop must develop here and there is no reason to postpone it. It also
gives White a look at Black's next developing move before making any other
decisions about piece placement.} 7...Nc6 ( 7...O-O {seems more consistent with
the early Bishop move, also waiting to see where to go with the Nb8.} ) 8.Bxc6+ 
$5 {Tarjan is the only one in the database to play this, sending the game on to
a different strategic path. It is a classic trade-off decision, eliminating the
strong White bishop but inflicting permanent structural damage on Black and
providing White with relatively easy targets to work against. The engines
evaluate the position as equal.} ( 8.Nf3 {is of course the conventional move.} 
) 8...bxc6 9.Nf3 {developing and attacking e5.} 9...Qd6 ( 9...f6 {would be the
more standard way to protect the pawn in similar Black structures.} ) 10.O-O 
{tucking the king away before Black can play ...Bh3. Interestingly, the engines
do not consider this such a problem.} ( 10.Rc1 $5 {immediately moving to
increase pressure on the c-file.} 10...Bh3 11.Qc2 $11 {White's king is in no
danger and the rook can go to g1 and still be useful.} ) 10...Bf5 $6 {this
fights for the e4 square, but not very effectively, considering White's next
move.} ( 10...Bh3 ) ( 10...O-O ) 11.d3 $14 {now White is threatening Ne4, with a
discovered attack on the e5 pawn.} 11...Qe6 {avoiding a double attack on the
queen after White's next.} 12.Ne4 {Black now has an important strategic decision
to make. Her choice to castle queenside is very imbalancing and appears to go
against the position's needs. Kosteniuk must have felt that either the king was
safe enough there, despite the weak pawns, or that she would be able to attack
White first.} 12...O-O-O $6 {Black tactically protects e5, as the Ne4 is now
hanging due to the pinned d-pawn. However, White gets out of the pin by moving
his queen to a better square, lining up on the c-file, so it is a net minus for
Black.} ( 12...f6 {is the engine recommendation, protecting the pawn.} ) ( 
12...Bxe4 $6 {looks like a reasonable idea, inflicting some pawn structure
damage on White in return. However, Black's c-pawns are still worse than White's
e-pawns and Black would no longer have the two bishops.} ) 13.Qc2 $16 f6 
14.Rfc1 {putting a rook on c1 is clearly a good idea, creating a battery with
additional pressure. An argument could be made for moving the other rook, since
the a-pawn will not need its support to advance, but White evidently wanted to
put both heavy pieces on the queenside.} 14...Kb7 {a reasonable-looking
defensive move, but Black may be better off looking for some counterplay.} ( 
14...Bg4 $5 {is the engines' preference, threatening to exchange on f3 and
undermine White's d-pawn.} ) 15.b4 $5 {a move that no amateur would be likely to
consider, as it just appears to lose a pawn.} ( 15.a4 {is the more obvious way
of launching operations on the queenside.} ) 15...Bxb4 16.Rab1 {now we see the
idea of the pawn sacrifice, to attack down the b-file. It appears to be slower
than alternatives, though, as Black looks to equalize with ...Rd5 or exchange
off an attacking piece with ...Bxe4. In practical terms, it is still difficult
to meet, however.} ( 16.a4 Rd5 17.a5 Nd7 18.Bxe5 $5 fxe5 ) 16...Be7 {withdraws
the bishop from its current vulnerable square, eliminating tactics involving a
discovered attack after the Bb2 moves (for example Bd4 or Bxe5). This does
little to impede White's attacking ideas, however.} ( 16...Rd5 {this defends
along the 5th rank, although White still has pressure and tactical ideas in the
center against the rook and bishop. For example} 17.Bd4 Ba3 18.Nc5+ Bxc5 
19.Bxc5 e4 20.Nd4 Rxd4 {the defensive exchange sacrifice is necessary} ( 
20...Qd7 $2 21.dxe4 ) 21.Bxd4 {at this point the engine shows complete equality,
despite the material difference, meaning that with accurate defensive play Black
will be all right. If Kosteniuk calculated this far, however, it would hardly
look appetizing.} ) ( 16...Bxe4 $5 {may be the best practical choice here,
eliminating an attacking piece and reducing complexity.} 17.dxe4 a5 {physically
impeding White's future a-pawn advance} 18.a3 Be7 $14 ) 17.a4 {with the idea of
pushing away the knight. Bringing another piece into the attack might boost its
effectiveness.} ( 17.Nfd2 {appears to be a useful preparatory move, as the Nf3
now is not doing much otherwise.} ) ( 17.Bc3 ) 17...Ka8 {getting off the open
file.} 18.a5 Nd7 {although Black has been pushed around, White does not have
anything decisive and now looks to recover the pawn. However, there is no rush
to do so and he ends up in a slightly worse position with the move played, so
alternatives are worth looking at.} 19.Qa4 ( 19.Ra1 $5 {with the idea of Ba3 and
trading off White's worse bishop, helping fight for the dark squares onthe
queenside.} ) ( 19.Qxc6+ Qxc6 20.Rxc6 {regains the pawn more forthrightly and
seems to give Black less leeway than the game continuation.} ) 19...Rb8 
{challenging on the open file and giving back the pawn for equality.} ( 
19...Nb8 $6 {is a move amateurs might play, defending the c6 pawn at all cost.
This would renew White's attacking chances, however. For example} 20.Nfd2 Rd5 
21.Ba3 Bxa3 22.Qxa3 Na6 23.Rc4 {followed by Rbc1.} ) 20.Rxc6 {this forces
Black's next move, otherwise the c-pawn is lost.} 20...Qb3 21.Qxb3 Rxb3 22.Nfd2 
{finally the knight gets into the action.} ( 22.Rxc7 $2 {greed is punished by} 
22...Rhb8 23.Rc2 Ba3 $19 ) 22...Rb7 {now Black is doing fine and the open b-file
is more of a benefit for her than it is for her opponent.} 23.Rc2 {this
overprotects the Bb2, freeing the Rb1 to move, but seems a bit passive.} ( 
23.a6 $5 Rb6 24.Rxc7 Rhb8 25.Rc2 Rxa6 {with a slight advantage to Black, with
the passed a-pawn.} ) 23...Rhb8 24.Nc4 {overprotecting the Bb2 again and getting
the knight further into play.} 24...a6 {physically blocking the further advance
of the White a-pawn.} 25.Rbc1 {moving the rook out of the pin and doubling
pressure on the c-file. White has managed to rearrange his pieces to be less
awkward and can look to exchange off his worse dark-square bishop with Ba3.} 
25...Rb3 {this temporarily stops the bishop exchange idea, but White could still
insist on it.} 26.Bc3 ( 26.Ned2 R3b5 27.Ba3 Bxa3 28.Nxa3 Rxa5 29.Nac4 Rc5 
30.Ra2 Rc6 31.Rca1 $11 {with play against the a-pawn.} ) ( 26.f4 $5 {could also
be played immediately.} ) 26...Be6 {Black again passes up the chance to exchange
on e4. This seems to help validate White's previous move, though, as the bishop
is now more useful on the a5-e1 diagonal protecting the a-pawn.} ( 26...Bxe4 
27.dxe4 Nc5 ) 27.f4 $6 {one of the common cases where playing the right idea at
the wrong time - one tempo later, in this case - could result in a setback.} 
27...exf4 {Black makes the obvious move, to avoid losing the e-pawn (attacked
three times, defended twice).} ( 27...Bxc4 {this possibility is the difference.} 
28.dxc4 exf4 29.gxf4 Nc5 30.Ng3 Bd6 31.e3 $17 {now White has three weak pawns
(a5, c4, e3) to defend and Black's pieces are much better placed.} ) 28.gxf4 
{this allows Black to play ...Bxc4 again, but she overlooks this.} ( 28.Ncd2 
{is the engines' recommendation, sacrificing the pawn for vigorous piece play.} 
) 28...R3b5 29.Bd4 $11 {now White is completely equal.} 29...Bb4 {attempting to
pick up the a-pawn. Komodo recommends to simply ignore it, as White's rooks
could then make threats on the c-file.} ( 29...Bxc4 30.Rxc4 $11 ) 30.Bc3 {an
equal defensive move. Given the repetition of moves that occurs here, it appears
both players were likely low on time.} ( 30.Ne3 $5 {this unleashes the rooks.} 
30...Bxa5 31.Rc6 Bb6 32.Bxb6 R8xb6 33.Rxc7 $16 ) 30...Be7 31.Bd4 R8b7 32.Kg2 
{White appears to be just marking time here. Perhaps this succeeded in provoking
Black's next, which is a non-obvious blunder.} 32...Kb8 $2 {this appears to be a
reasonable move, getting the king out of the corner and reinforcing the pawn on
c7. It has a tactical problem, though, which Tarjan finds.} ( 32...Bd5 {or
moving to f7 or g8 would avoid the problem, which is created by the king making
itself vulnerable to a back-rank check, physically blocking the rook from coming
back to b8.} ) 33.Ncd6 $1 {an example of a reloader tactic on d6, made possible
by the threat of Rc8+} 33...Bxd6 ( 33...Rb1 {the engines suggest leaving the
bishop on the board rather than exchange it, but it's still a win for White, who
is up the exchange with no compensation for Black.} 34.Nxb7 Rxb7 ( 34...Rxc1 
35.Rxc1 Kxb7 36.Nc5+ $18 ) 35.Kf2 $18 ) 34.Nxd6 {and now Black loses material.} 
34...Rd5 35.Nxb7 Rxd4 36.Nd8 Bd5+ 37.e4 Kc8 38.Nc6 Bxc6 39.Rxc6 Rxd3 40.Rxc7+ 
$18 {at the end of the sequence, White is simple an exchange up with a
dominating rook pair.} 40...Kd8 41.Ra7 {both getting behind the a-pawn and
leaving the c7 square potentially available for the other rook.} 41...Rd6 
42.Kf3 g5 {attempting to get any counterplay possible, by breaking up the pawn
shield in front of White's king, or getting a kingside pawn majority.} 43.Rg1 
h6 {this looks like it is reinforcing the g-pawn, but ends up giving another
pawn to White.} 44.h4 {another interesting master idea, although an amateur
might have more of a chance of spotting this tactic. The h-pawn cannot be taken
due to the mate, and Black's g-pawn cannot be further reinforced, so it is
lost.} 44...Ke7 45.hxg5 hxg5 46.fxg5 fxg5 47.Rxg5 Kf6 48.Kf4 Ke6 49.Rg6+ Nf6 
{allowing one final tactic.} 50.Rxf6+ {and now the pawn forks on e5 after the
rook is recaptured.} 1-0
