1.Nf3 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c5 {surprisingly, Black scores over 56 percent from this
very unassuming position.} 4.e3 {opting for central play, rather than
fianchettoing the bishop.} 4...Nf6 5.d4 O-O 6.Be2 cxd4 7.Nxd4 d5 {Black's score
is now over 61 percent in the database, with this Grunfeld-type setup.} 8.O-O 
dxc4 9.Bxc4 a6 {White's score from here is now abysmal, with close to 75 percent
for Black. A case of the visual impression of the board not conforming to its
reality. White's pieces look more developed, but Black will remedy that shortly
and has much more harmonious development. Meanwhile, White in reality is not
very coordinated and the dark-square bishop is a problem.} 10.a4 Qc7 11.Ba2 
$146 ( 11.Qb3 {scores best here, although still at a poor 36 percent.} ) ( 
11.Qe2 $5 ) 11...Rd8 12.Bd2 {White is looking quite awkward.} 12...e5 13.Nf3 
Nc6 ( 13...Bg4 $15 {looks like the logical follow-up. Among other things it
threatens Bxf3, after which White would have to capture with the g-pawn, due to
the otherwise hanging Bd2. Black in this variation develops a piece strongly and
has the initiative.} ) 14.Ng5 $11 {while the threat is easily parried, it does
cause Black to reverse her development and disrupts her initiative.} 14...Rf8 
15.Rc1 {White looks OK now, with the position being equal. Her pieces are now
more active and doing useful things, other than getting in each others' way.} 
15...e4 $6 ( 15...h6 {chasing the knight and freeing up the Rf8 looks like a
good plan here.} ) 16.Ngxe4 Nxe4 17.Nxe4 Bxb2 {Lagno must have mis-evaluated
this position when playing her 15th move, not seeing White's follow-up threats.} 
18.Qc2 {a subtle but strong move.} 18...Bg7 19.Bb4 $1 {White's active bishops
now dominate and slice Black's position up, thanks to the pin on the Nc6.} 
19...Rd8 {now the pendulum has swung back in White's favor, with Black's pieces
under pressure and uncoordinated.} 20.Ng5 {now Black really could use that pawn
on h6.} 20...Bf5 {Black appears desperate for counterplay.} 21.e4 Qf4 22.Nxf7 
Rd4 23.Bd6 {White has multiple ways to win.} ( 23.exf5 Nxb4 24.Ng5+ Kh8 25.Qc8+ 
Rxc8 26.Rxc8+ Bf8 27.Rxf8+ Kg7 28.Ne6+ Kh6 29.Nxf4 Rxf4 $18 ) 23...Bxe4 (

Re8 26.Ng5+ Kh8 27.Nxe4 Rdxe4 28.Qxc6 {White converts her advantage into
material gain. Black has no counterplay and White's bishops continue to
dominate, landing the final blow on move 30.} 28...h5 29.a5 Qg5 30.Bf7 1-0
