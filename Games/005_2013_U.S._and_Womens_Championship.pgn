1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 b6 3.g3 c5 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.O-O Nc6 {this move varies from a the
typical Hedgehog setup.} 6.Nc3 g6 7.e3 ( 7.d4 {would be the standard analagous
continuation in a Hedgehog and in fact scores over 70 percent for White. The
text move also scores well, 65 percent.} ) 7...Bg7 8.d4 {now White would be able
to replace the pawn on d4 if it is exchanged.} 8...O-O 9.d5 {as Black declines
to exchange on d4, White now grabs space with d5. The pawn structure is now that
of a more typical queen's pawn opening.} 9...Na5 10.Qd3 e6 {Black decides to
immediately challenge the head of the pawn chain.} 11.e4 exd5 12.exd5 d6 {now we
have a Benoni-type structure. White appears to have a comfortable game.} 13.Bf4 
Bc8 14.b3 Bf5 15.Qd2 Re8 16.Rae1 Qd7 $6 {this cuts off the retreat squares for
the Bf5.} ( 16...Nb7 $5 ) 17.Nh4 Nb7 18.Nb5 {this perhaps was played to see if
Black would go wrong before the capture.} ( 18.Nxf5 ) 18...Nh5 {and Black does.
The d6 pawn is vulnerable after the exchange on f5.} ( 18...Be4 ) 19.Nxf5 Qxf5 
( 19...gxf5 20.Rxe8+ Rxe8 21.Nxa7 Nxf4 22.Qxf4 Re2 23.Nb5 h6 24.Bh3 Qe8 ( 
24...Rxa2 25.Re1 ) 25.a3 $18 ) 20.Bxd6 Rxe1 21.Rxe1 Nxd6 22.Nxd6 $16 {White is
now up a protected passed pawn and Black has no compensation for it.} 22...Qd7 
23.Nb5 a6 24.d6 {aggressively pushing the pawn whenever possible. Here the
discovered attack on the Ra8 is the tactical mechanism.} 24...Rd8 ( 24...Re8 $5
$16 ) 25.Re7 $18 Qf5 26.Nc7 ( 26.Bd5 {is Houdini's recommended tactic.} 
26...axb5 27.Rxf7 Qxf7 28.Bxf7+ Kxf7 29.Qd5+ Kf8 30.Qc6 $18 ) 26...Nf6 27.Bd5 
Nxd5 28.Nxd5 Bf8 29.d7 {more tactics allow the passed pawn push.} 29...Qb1+ ( 
29...Rxd7 $2 30.Rxd7 Qxd7 31.Nf6+ ) 30.Re1 Qf5 31.Re8 {White now finishes off
his opponent with a tactical flourish.} 31...Rxd7 32.Qh6 Qb1+ 33.Kg2 Qe4+ 
34.Rxe4 {Black now loses the rook, not having the time to both recapture the
queen and move out of the way of the fork with Nf6+} 1-0
