1.Nf3 Nf6 {a noncommital response to White's first move, while ruling out an
immediate e4 as follow-up.} 2.g3 d5 3.Bg2 c6 4.O-O Bg4 {this is slightly more
challenging than the other standard move developing the bishop to f5.} 5.d3 
{continuing with the standard plan of the King's Indian Attack setup. White will
eventually play e4.} 5...Nbd7 {the knight needs to be developed in any case, and
this provides the option of supporting an ...e5 push.} 6.h3 Bh5 7.Qe1 {getting
off the h5-d1 diagonal and behind the e-pawn.} 7...e5 {played the vast majority
of the time, forming a pawn duo in the center.} ( 7...e6 {is certainly possible,
but is unambitious and drawish.} ) 8.e4 dxe4 {not necessarily obligatory, but
almost always played. The following game shows how problems can develop for
Black by delaying it.} ( 8...Bd6 9.exd5 Bxf3 10.Bxf3 Nxd5 11.Nc3 Nxc3 12.bxc3

g6 41.Re3 {1-0 (41) Movsesian,S (2695)-Zontakh,A (2546) Loo 2013} ) 9.dxe4 Bc5 
{developing the bishop to its most effective diagonal.} 10.a4 a5 {preventing a
b4 advance.} 11.Na3 {actually the most common move played here, but scoring only
46 percent for White in the database. The point is to transfer the knight to
c4.} 11...O-O 12.Nc4 Qc7 {protecting e5 and connecting the rooks.} 13.Bd2 b6 
{the obvious move, to ensure the a5 pawn is protected and Black's pieces are not
tied down to it.} 14.Nh4 {intending to go to f5, but the knight ends up stuck
here for a long time before exchanging itself for the bishop on g6.} 14...Rfe8 
{developing the rook, which was doing nothing on f8.} 15.Kh1 {getting off the
a7-g1 diagonal and preparing to push the f-pawn.} 15...Bg6 {anticipating the
push g4 and pressuring e4, essentially inviting the following exchange.} 
16.Nxg6 hxg6 {although White now has the two bishops, the individual minor piece
trade is a fine idea for Black. Her light-square bishop was not doing anything
very important and the White knight on the kingside otherwise could effectively
support a pawn advance and/or could go to f5.} 17.f4 {a natural move, but
perhaps White could have taken some more time to prepare it. Black is able to
launch a counterstroke on the queenside.} 17...b5 {the tactics work in Black's
favor if White accepts the pawn sacrifice.} 18.Bxa5 ( 18.Nxa5 {is inferior, as
the Na5 is out on a limb and its protectors can become overloaded, while Black
has multiple other threats.} 18...exf4 19.axb5 f3 20.Rxf3 ( 20.Bxf3 cxb5 $15 
{and now Black can threaten the g3 and c2 pawns after ...Bd6.} ) 20...cxb5 
21.Rb3 Bd6 $15 22.Re3 ( 22.Rxb5 $2 Nc5 $17 ) ) 18...Qc8 19.axb5 cxb5 20.Nd2 
{the engine assesses the position as equal, as White's pieces are not as well
coordinated as her opponent's and Black can start making threats along the
e-file.} 20...exf4 21.gxf4 Nd5 {a key move in the sequence, as the knight takes
advantage of the pinned e-pawn to use d5 as an outpost and threaten to go to
e3.} 22.Rf3 {defending the e3 square, albeit awkwardly.} ( 22.b4 $5 {is a
recurring idea in this position that the engines identify. White at least
temporarily gives back the pawn in order to better activate her pieces and
deflect Black's threats. For example} 22...Nxb4 23.Qb1 Nc6 24.Qxb5 Nxa5 25.Rxa5 
Rxa5 26.Qxa5 Nf6 $11 ) 22...f5 $6 {this invites the advance of the e-pawn, which
essentially solves White's problems with it.} ( 22...N7f6 {would increase the
pressure and not allow for the advance, as if} 23.e5 $6 Nh5 $17 {and now the
f-pawn is under fire.} ) 23.e5 g5 {evidently this was Paikidze's idea, to
pressure the e-pawn by undermining its support. White is faced with some complex
choices.} 24.fxg5 $2 {this was unnecessary and justifies Black's play.} ( 
24.Qd1 {would get the queen out of the pin first and improve on the idea.} 
24...gxf4 $2 ( 24...N7b6 25.fxg5 Rxe5 26.b4 Bxb4 27.Bxb4 Nxb4 28.Rxa8 Nxa8 
29.Rb3 $16 ) ( 24...Nxf4 $2 25.Rxf4 gxf4 26.Bd5+ Kf8 27.Qh5 $16 ) 25.Nc4 bxc4 
26.Qxd5+ $18 ) ( 24.b4 $5 {has similar ideas as in the variation above. The
hanging Nd5 and the open long diagonal give White some tactical possibilities
and Black has to be careful.} ) 24...Nxe5 {Black now takes over the initiative.
The two centralized knights in combination with the Re8 and Bc5 can make a
variety of threats in this wide-open position.} 25.Rf2 $2 {preserving the rook
in this way just leads to more trouble for White. The engines suggest a
positional exchange sacrifice.} ( 25.Qg3 $5 Nxf3 26.Bxf3 $17 ) ( 25.Rf1 Ne3 $17 
) 25...Ne3 $19 {it's clear by this point that for the investment of a pawn,
Black's pieces are now dominating the game. This is a more positional road to
victory.} ( 25...Nd3 $1 {is even stronger, with a double attack on the queen and
rook. White loses material in all lines, for example} 26.Bxd5+ Kh7 27.cxd3 
Rxe1+ 28.Rxe1 Bxf2 $19 ) 26.Nb3 {protecting the c2 pawn by opening the second
rank, but it would be safer to get the queen out of danger with Qb1.} 26...Nxg2 
{Black again passes up the ...Nd3 tactic.} 27.Rxg2 $17 f4 {following the precept
that passed pawns must be pushed, although this reduces the pressure of Black's
pieces.} ( 27...Nf3 $5 ) 28.Qc3 Nc4 ( 28...f3 {is favored by the engines and is
the logical continuation of the previous move's idea.} ) 29.Qf3 {White has been
doing a good job of containing Black's threats as best she can and the engines
show only a slight advantage for Black at this point.} 29...Qf5 $15 30.Nxc5 
{White logically wants to eliminate Black's strong bishop, but now the Ba5 is
hanging. This is a case of where "doing something" in a position is actually
inferior to waiting.} ( 30.g6 $5 {is the engine recommendation, a waiting move
that also restricts Black's king.} 30...Rac8 31.Qg4 Qxg4 32.Rxg4 Bd6 $15 ) 
30...Qxc5 31.b4 Qf5 $17 {looking at how the position has transformed, White's
bishop is now largely locked away, although may get back into the action via c7.
Meanwhile Black's control of the e-file and the well-placed Nc4 are key
advantages; the Ra8 can also easily get into the action.} 32.Rf2 Re4 33.Rg1 
Rae8 34.Bc7 $2 {an apparently logical idea, to increase pressure on the f-pawn
and have the bishop do something useful, but now Black's domination of the
e-file and her rooks will decide the game.} ( 34.Kh2 {would protect the h-pawn,
which is vulnerable to pressure along the 3rd rank.} ) ( 34.Qg4 ) 34...Re3 $1
$19 35.Qxf4 Rxh3+ {a good example of the principle of looking for tactical
exchanges, in this case the f-pawn for the h-pawn, since White could not take
and also protect at the same time. Obviously the loss of the h-pawn hurts White
much more than the f-pawn does Black, due to White's vulnerable king.} 36.Kg2 
Ne3+ 37.Qxe3 {forced.} 37...Qg4+ {here the value of the tactic of gaining a
tempo is illustrated, with White's queen moving out of danger.} 38.Qg3 Rxg3+ 
39.Bxg3 Re3 40.Kh2 Qh5+ {a nice little tactic to pick up the g-pawn and give
Black a passed pawn on the kingside.} 41.Kg2 Qxg5 {White does not have
compensation for being down material (R+B vs Q). It is instructive to see how
Black's Q+R combination holds the initiative and how White is essentially
helpless to do anything from this point forward.} 42.Kh2 Re6 43.Rgg2 Qh5+ 
44.Kg1 Qd1+ 45.Rf1 Qd4+ 46.Rff2 Re1+ 47.Kh2 Qd1 48.Bf4 Qh5+ 49.Kg3 Rh1 50.Rh2 
Rg1+ 51.Rhg2 Rh1 52.Rh2 Qg6+ 53.Kh3 Qe6+ 54.Kg3 Re1 55.Rhg2 Qg6+ 56.Kh2 Qe4 
57.Bg5 Qxb4 {an illustration of the power of the queen to reposition herself
with tempo and then pick up additional material in an endgame.} 58.Bf4 ( 58.Bf6 
$2 Qd6+ 59.Kh3 Rh1+ 60.Kg4 gxf6 $19 ) 58...Qe7 59.Kg3 Re6 60.Kh3 Qd7 61.Kh2 Re4 
62.Kg3 Qf5 63.Rf3 g5 {Black is now able to bring another piece into the attack.} 
64.Bxg5 {one last attempt at setting a trap.} 64...Rg4+ {the tactical
intermediate move that finishes things off.} ( 64...Qxg5+ $4 65.Kh3 ) 0-1
