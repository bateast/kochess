1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nc3 e6 4.g3 b6 {Black decides to head for a Hedgehog
formation.} 5.Bg2 Bb7 6.O-O Be7 {the standard Hedgehog position in the English.} 
7.Re1 {this postpones d4 in order to support an e4 push.} 7...O-O 8.e4 d6 {the
key part of the Hedgehog pawn structure. Black's pawns along the 6th rank act as
a barrier against any White initiatives. The d-pawn needs to be guarded well,
however, as the d-file will be opened by White.} 9.d4 cxd4 {otherwise White
gains a true space advantage after the d5 advance.} 10.Nxd4 Nfd7 11.Be3 Ne5 
{while centralized, the knight is going to be vulnerable to the f4 push, which
later turns out to be decisive.} 12.b3 Nbc6 13.h3 $146 {a prophylactic move
against the harrassing ...Ng4} ( 13.f4 {was played immediately in the following
game:} 13...Nxd4 14.Bxd4 Nc6 15.Bf2 Rc8 16.Rc1 Qc7 17.Qd2 Qb8 18.g4 Rfd8 19.g5

13...Nxd4 14.Qxd4 Bf6 {the threat here seems a bit cheap, while withdrawing
support from d6.} 15.Qd2 a6 $2 {The Qd8 is now forced to cover both d6 and b6,
something which White can take advantage of. Remarkably, Black is essentially
busted out of the opening at this point.} ( 15...Be7 {would be rather humbling,
but would limit White's advantage.} ) 16.Rad1 Be7 17.f4 {kicking the knight with
tempo and allowing the queen into the f2 square.} 17...Nc6 18.Qf2 {Black now has
no good options regarding the fatally weak b-pawn.} 18...Qb8 {this further
reinforces the e5 square, but otherwise buries the queen.} ( 18...b5 19.cxb5 
axb5 20.Nxb5 Nb4 21.a4 d5 22.exd5 Bxd5 $16 ) 19.Bxb6 Bd8 20.Re2 {White now has
the obvious follow-up plan of doubling rooks on the d-file.} 20...Ne7 21.Red2 
Bxb6 22.Qxb6 Nc8 23.Qe3 $18 {White is a clear pawn to the good and holds all the
positional trumps, including well-developed pieces and a space advantage.
Houdini evalutes the position as more than 2 pawns in White's favor.} 23...Bc6 
24.Ne2 Ra7 25.Nd4 Ba8 26.Nf3 ( 26.f5 ) 26...f6 27.Nd4 {it's unclear whether
White was simply repeating moves here in order to help with the time control, or
had some other purpose. In any case, the follow-up break of f5 is the key and
could have been played earlier.} 27...Re7 28.f5 e5 {attempting to play in a more
closed fashion, but giving away the e6 square to make an outstanding outpost for
the knight.} ( 28...exf5 29.Nxf5 Re5 30.Nxd6 Nxd6 31.Rxd6 {also looks good for
White, however.} ) 29.Ne6 Rfe8 30.c5 {White keeps up the pressure.} 30...Qa7 
31.b4 Bc6 {attempting to blockade the pawns' progress.} 32.Kh2 {White chooses
safety first, getting the king off the a7-g1 diagonal before moving forward with
her breakthrough.} 32...dxc5 33.bxc5 Bd7 34.Bf1 {White needs to get this bishop
into the game and can ignore the buildup against e6 for tactical reasons.} 
34...Bxe6 35.fxe6 {and the pawn is tactically defended, due to the skewer on the
a2-g8 diagonal.} 35...Rc7 $2 {this loses quickly, due to allowing the
penetration on the 8th rank to have greater effect, but Black had no counterplay
in any case.} ( 35...Qb7 ) 36.Rd8 Kf8 ( 36...Rxd8 37.Rxd8# ) 37.Rxe8+ Kxe8 
38.Qd2 {mate is now inevitable.} 38...Ke7 39.Qd8+ 1-0
