1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 {the Modern defense.} 3.Nf3 ( 3.Nc3 {is played much more often
here and scores better (at 54 percent) in the database. However, there are
obviously a lot of transposition possibilities.} ) 3...d6 4.Be3 {White
super-focuses on reinforcing d4.} 4...Nd7 5.Nc3 a6 {the Modern is not about
taking on White directly, but restricting potential activity. Black here takes
away the b5 square, for example.} 6.a4 {restraining ...b5 in turn.} 6...b6 
7.Bc4 e6 8.Qd2 {White now chooses to emphasize piece play.} ( 8.h4 $5 {is a more
aggressive alternative that Black has found hard to meet. Here is a sample game
from GM Robert Hess:} 8...h6 9.h5 g5 10.Qd3 Qe7 11.d5 Ngf6 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.e5

47.cxb4 Qh6 48.Bd5+ Kc7 49.Ra8 {1-0, Robert L Hess 2609 - Samy Shoker 2475, WchT
8th, Ningbo (3.4), 2011.07.19} ) 8...Bb7 9.Bg5 Ndf6 {this looks strange, but the
point is to develop the other knight to e7, from where it can fight for d5 and
f5.} 10.Qe2 {after this, the engine considers the position completely even, with
perhaps a slight advantage to Black. White retreats her pieces, meaning the
previous development was largely ineffective.} 10...h6 11.Bh4 {choosing to
maintain the bishop's presence on the kingside. Bd2 seems more flexible.} 
11...g5 {a commital move, with the intent of forcing a piece trade. A more
standard developing alternative would be ...Ne7.} 12.Bg3 Nh5 13.O-O-O {the best
place for the king, as O-O would then give more punch to Black's trade on g3,
with prospects for further kingside pawn advances to open up the position.} 
13...Ne7 14.Ne1 {forcing Black to commit with the Nh5. However, this was
presumably her intent anyway with the knight, so perhaps something more active
is indicated.} ( 14.d5 $5 {Black's king is still in the center and White's rook
is now in play on d1, so this seems like a good time to advance.} ) 14...Nxg3 
15.hxg3 {the usual rule of capturing towards the center applies in this
position. White maintains a connected pawn formation and usefully opens the
h-file for the rook.} 15...Qd7 {developing the queen and clearing the back rank
for possible queenside castling.} 16.d5 {this ends up being a premature break in
the center. White has just retreated the knight, so her forces are not fully
marshaled to support her in the center.} ( 16.f4 $5 {is the engine's
preference.} ) 16...exd5 17.Nxd5 {with the game continuation, this seems fine,
but the engine suggests that Black is better without further exchanges on d5.} 
17...Bxd5 ( 17...b5 {seems most to the point, getting Black's play on the
queenside started against White's king, although it involves a pawn sacrifice.} 
18.Nxe7 Qxe7 19.axb5 axb5 20.Bxb5+ c6 21.Bc4 O-O $17 {White's king position is
much worse and Black will also be able to take over the initiative in the
center, for example after ...Rfe8 and ...d5.} ) ( 17...O-O {also looks good.} ) 
18.Bxd5 Nxd5 19.exd5+ Kf8 {Black is still equal here, despite having lost the
right to castle. Material is reduced, lessening the chance of a kingside attack
succeeding for White, and Black has good prospects on the queenside.} 20.Qe4 
{actively centralizing the queen.} 20...Re8 {logically kicking the queen off of
the excellent e4 square, but it still moves to another good square.} 21.Qc4 b5 
{forcing the opening of lines on the queenside.} 22.axb5 {necessary to avoid the
opening of the b-file after ...bxa4, which would increase the vulnerability of
the White king.} 22...axb5 23.Qb3 $6 {this is too passive a square for the
queen.} ( 23.Qc6 ) 23...Ra8 24.Nd3 {White correctly ignores the possibility of a
check on a1, which would gain Black nothing, as she is not in a position to
effectively go after White's king on d2. The knight needs to get back in the
game.} 24...Bf6 {clearing g7 for the king.} 25.f3 {this fights for g4 and also
ensures the f-pawn is protected by another pawn, otherwise it could be pressured
after ...Qf5 in some lines.} 25...Kg7 {now Black's rooks are connected.} ( 
25...h5 {is the engine's suggestion, a prophylactic move against what White
plays next.} ) 26.g4 {the logical follow-up, controlling f5 and h5 and blocking
further advances of Black's pawns.} 26...c5 {another commital pawn move by
Black. This will result in a half-open c-file, but Black's pawn structure is
weakened.} 27.dxc6 Qxc6 28.c3 {now it seems more evident that Black does not
have enough attacking potential against the White king.} 28...Qb6 {putting the
queen on a more useful diagonal and threatening ...Qe3+} 29.Kc2 Rac8 $6 {it
seems counterintuitive to leave the open a-file, reducing the number of
potential threats Black could try to make. Moving the other rook to c8 is
preferred by the engine.} 30.Nb4 {White's knight now greatly improves its
scope.} 30...Be5 {defending the d-pawn and getting on the better b8-h2
diagonal.} 31.Nd5 Qa7 32.Rd2 {allowing for possibly doubling rooks on the
d-file, while covering the 2nd rank.} ( 32.Qxb5 $2 {pawn snatching here in fact
does open too many lines against White's king.} 32...Rb8 33.Qd3 Qa2 34.Rb1 Rhc8 
$19 {now with the c-pawn pinned, the Nd5 has nowhere useful to go and becomes a
target after ...Rc5, which then gives Black additional threats against White's
king position.} ) 32...Rb8 33.Re1 Rhc8 $6 {this looks very reasonable, but now
White continues with her rook lift idea.} ( 33...b4 {is found by the engine. It
is counter-intuitive, since it looks like it just loses a pawn.} 34.Nxb4 Rb5 
$10 {and now Black gets active play on the queenside to compensate for the pawn,
with the ability to double major pieces on either the a- or b-files.} ) 34.Re4 
{now the ...b4 idea is no longer possible, which means Black has no way to make
progress on the queenside.} 34...Kh7 35.Nb4 {while the knight looked good on d5,
it lacked targets. Note that the a2-g8 diagonal is also now open for the queen,
pressuring f7.} 35...Rc5 $2 {while in some earlier variations this rook move
would have made sense, here its awkward placement will cause immediate problems
for Black.} ( 35...Kg6 {Black needs to think defensively and this would protect
f7.} ) 36.Nd3 {Black now has no good moves with the rook.} 36...Rc4 ( 36...Rc7 
37.Qd5 Bg3 38.Rb4 $16 {and White has all the play in the position.} ) 37.Rxc4 
{now White just picks up a pawn.} ( 37.Nxe5 {is suggested as even better by the
engine.} 37...dxe5 38.Rxe5 ) 37...bxc4 38.Qxc4 $18 Bf6 $6 {the bishop is hanging
here and Black's queen remains tied to protecting f7.} ( 38...Kg8 {again would
help cover f7, although Black still has major problems.} ) 39.Nb4 {uncovering
the attack on the isolated d-pawn.} 39...Qa4+ 40.Qb3 {White would be quite happy
to simplify here with an exchange of queens.} 40...Qe8 {correctly choosing to
protect the f-pawn over the d-pawn.} 41.Rxd6 {White is now up two connected
passed pawns, which would be hard to lose, especially at the Master level.
White's somewhat exposed king position perhaps gave Black some hope of drawing,
however.} 41...Be5 42.Rd1 Bf4 43.Kb1 Kg8 44.Qc2 {extricating the queen from the
pin on the Nb4.} 44...Ra8 45.Nd5 {threatening the fork on f6.} 45...Be5 46.Qe4 
{a powerful centralization of the queen.} 46...Rb8 47.Rd2 Kg7 {Black lacks any
real ideas in the position, although this allows White to further simplify by
force or win additional material.} 48.Re2 {now the bishop is pinned.} 48...f6 
49.Nxf6 Qd8 {hoping to be able to get in ...Qd1+} ( 49...Kxf6 50.Qf5+ Kg7 
51.Qxe5+ Qxe5 52.Rxe5 $18 ) 50.Nh5+ Kg8 51.Qg6+ ( 51.Kc1 {this may be the best
practical move here for normal players, taking away any worries about Black
counterplay.} ) 51...Kh8 52.Qxh6+ Kg8 53.Qe6+ Kh7 54.Kc2 Qa5 55.Qf5+ Kh6 
56.Rxe5 $2 {this allows a neat tactical draw for Black, which of course is
difficult to see at the board. Black's king is cornered and there is very little
material on the board for her, which should be the cue for a stalemate theme.} 
( 56.Qxe5 ) 56...Qa4+ $2 {Missing the stalemate idea. White now has only one
move, but it is not hard to find.} ( 56...Rxb2+ 57.Kxb2 ( 57.Kd3 {running
doesn't help, as all Black has to do is give away all her material, or gain a
perpetual check. For example} 57...Rd2+ 58.Ke4 ( 58.Ke3 $4 Qxc3+ {and mates.} ) 
58...Qa4+ 59.Ke3 Re2+ 60.Kd3 ( 60.Kxe2 Qe4+ 61.Kf1 Qe1+ $10 ) 60...Qd1+ $10 ) 
57...Qxc3+ $10 {now it's a stalemate if White takes the queen, or a perpetual
check if she doesn't.} ) 57.Kc1 Qa1+ 58.Qb1 {now it's all over.} 58...Qa6 
59.Ng3 {White finds the best idea in the position, reactivating her knight and
opening up against Black's king.} 59...Rd8 60.Nf5+ Kh7 61.Nd6+ Kh8 62.Nf7+ Kg7 
63.Nxd8 Qf1+ {one last try in desperation.} 64.Kc2 Qf2+ 65.Kd3 1-0
