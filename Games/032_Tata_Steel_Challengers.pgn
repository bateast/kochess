1.d4 e6 2.c4 b6 $5 {this actually is "hot" according to ChessBase and scores 50
percent. Although statistics are mostly meaningless this early in a game, it's
still an indication that the move should not be dismissed. There are many
transpositional possibilities, one of the attractions of the move.} 3.a3 
{prevents ...Bb4, preparing White's next move.} 3...f5 {transposing immediately
into a Dutch Defense. The majority of the time Bb7 is played first, but
Reinderman has other plans for the bishop deployment.} 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.g3 Ba6 ( 
5...Bb7 6.d5 {with an independent line of play.} ) 6.Bg2 c6 7.b3 ( 7.Qa4 {is the
other alternative that has been played, scoring 3-0 for White in the database.
It is an aggressive departure from standard development, but poses more probems
for Black on the queenside by pressuring the Ba6, c6 and b5.} ) 7...d5 $11 {now
Black has a rather favorable version of the Stonewall, where his light-square
bishop is already developed and White has not done anything comparably useful.} 
8.Nh3 {a common alternate plan in the Stonewall - instead of trying to dominate
e5, with the more standard Nf3, White's knight instead heads for f4.} 8...Bd6 
9.Nf4 Qe7 10.O-O Nbd7 11.cxd5 cxd5 12.a4 {White moves to establish an outpost on
b5, with the idea of trading knight for bishop.} 12...O-O 13.Nb5 Bxb5 {a
positional necessity. Black in the Stonewall normally tries to avoid trading off
the dark-square bishop, given his weakness on the dark squares, so takes the Nb5
with the other bishop. From White's standpoint, this rids Black of a strong
piece on the a6-f1 diagonal and opens the a-file for White's rook. From Black's
standpoint, White's queenside pawns are now weak and Black is left with a lead
in development.} 14.axb5 Rfc8 15.Bb2 Nf8 {Black overprotects e6, thereby freeing
up his queen.} ( 15...Bxf4 16.gxf4 Nf8 {is Houdini's preference, with the idea
of following up with ...Ng6-h4. Black's dark-square weakness is not easily
exploitable and White's two bishops are constrained by the pawn structure.} ) 
16.e3 Qd7 17.Qd3 Ne4 {a standard idea in the Stonewall. Here it may not be the
most effective immediate choice for Black.} ( 17...g5 $5 {is a more aggressive
approach, but fully in keeping with the Dutch.} 18.Ne2 h5 ) ( 17...Rc7 {is
another possibility, looking to immediately occupy the c-file.} ) 18.Ne2 Rc7 
19.Rfc1 Rac8 20.Rxc7 Qxc7 21.Rc1 Qd7 22.Rxc8 Qxc8 {by capturing with the queen
on move 20, the difference on move 22 after the additional rook exchange is that
the queen is on c8 rather than c7.} 23.f3 {this move is always expected after
the knight sortie to e4, but it of course further blocks the Bg2.} 23...Nf6 
24.Nc3 Bb4 {the bishop had no future on the b8-h2 diagonal.} 25.Na2 Bd6 26.Bc3 
{avoiding the repetition after Nc3. The position does not justify White's
playing for a win, however.} 26...Ng6 27.Nb4 Ne7 {the knight comes back to
defend c6, the point of the maneuver. Given the lack of a threat to e6, it was
also doing nothing on f8.} 28.Qd2 h6 29.Nd3 {clearing the square for the bishop,
as White is looking to exchange on d6.} 29...Qd7 30.Bb4 Ne8 {Black again
repositions a knight to a more effective square.} 31.Bxd6 Nxd6 32.Ne5 $6 {White
seems to be trying too hard for the win. Alternatively, perhaps he saw the
sequence through move 35 and incorrectly evaluated it as an easy draw.} ( 
32.Qb4 ) 32...Qxb5 33.Qc3 Nf7 $15 {Black finds the best defense to White's
threat to penetrate with the queen.} 34.Bf1 ( 34.Qc7 $2 Nxe5 35.Qxe7 Qd7 $17 
{and White has almost nothing to show for the sacrificed pawn.} ) 34...Qa5 
35.Qxa5 bxa5 {perhaps White evaluated this position as easily drawn, which turns
out not to be the case.} 36.Nd7 Nd6 37.Kf2 Nc6 {Black's knights keep looking
better and better.} 38.Nc5 Kf7 {time to activate the king, which is sufficient
to protect e6.} 39.Ke2 g5 {now Black seizes some space on the kingside.} 40.Kd3 
Ke7 41.Be2 $6 ( 41.Bg2 {and now} 41...f4 {does not work:} 42.gxf4 gxf4 43.Bh3 
$11 ) 41...f4 {Black finds the way to exploit the inaccuracy of the bishop's
location, using a temporary pawn sacrifice to undermine White's center and
achieve dominance with his knights.} 42.gxf4 gxf4 43.exf4 Nf5 44.Bf1 Ncxd4 $19 
{White now will lose 2 kingside pawns and can only pick up one of Black's on the
queenside in return.} 45.Bh3 {White must start desperately looking for
counterplay.} 45...Nxf3 46.Nb7 Nxh2 47.Nxa5 Kd7 48.b4 h5 49.Bxf5 exf5 50.Nb3 
{the endgame is now lost for White, although he apparently held out some hope
for a draw, perhaps by sacrificing his knight to eliminate all of Black's
pawns.} 50...Nf3 51.Ke3 Nh4 52.Nd4 Kc7 53.Kf2 Ng6 54.Kf3 Ne7 55.Kg3 Nc6 56.Nxf5

possible line of play shows:} 67...Nc4+ 68.Ka1 d4 69.Nf2 Kb4 70.Nd3+ Kc3 71.Nc1
