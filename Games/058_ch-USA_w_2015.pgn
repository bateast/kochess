1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5 4.Nf3 {White opts for a traditional Slav Exchange
variation, unlike in Timur Gareev's round 2 game with Bf4.} 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 
6.Bf4 Nh5 {a useful offbeat option, that scores the best of any 6th moves for
Black in the database.} ( 6...Bf5 {is the classical response.} ) 7.Be5 f6 8.Bg3 
Nxg3 ( 8...Bg4 $5 {is the engine's preference, although there are no games in
the database with this move. It looks somewhat counterintuitive, but perhaps is
worth further investigation.} ) 9.hxg3 e5 {the natural follow-up to the ...f6
push. Black gains some central space.} 10.e3 ( 10.dxe5 $6 {doesn't work due to} 
10...d4 {and now} 11.Nb1 Qa5+ 12.Nbd2 fxe5 $15 ) 10...e4 11.Nd2 Be6 {developing
the bishop and overprotecting d5.} 12.a3 {not the most challenging approach.} ( 
12.Ndxe4 {is now tactically possible, due to the pawn fork on d5.} 12...dxe4 
13.d5 Bxd5 14.Qxd5 ( 14.Nxd5 Qa5+ $11 ) 14...Qxd5 15.Nxd5 O-O-O 16.Rd1 {here
Black's king position is a little airy and White's pieces have slightly better
prospects, although after Black tucks his king away with . ..Kb8 the position
looks safe enough.} ) 12...Be7 $6 {Black here seems to either overlook or
discount the possibility of the pawn fork trick Ndxe4, which now after a3 has
been played could lead to more of an advantage for White.} ( 12...f5 $5 {would
address the issue.} ) 13.Be2 ( 13.Ndxe4 dxe4 14.d5 Bxd5 {and now} 15.Nxd5 {is
much more awkward for Black than in the above variation.} 15...Qa5+ {is no
longer good, due to the pawn advance b4, protected an additional time by the a3
pawn.} ) 13...O-O 14.b4 {in these types of positions Black appreciates the fact
that the b-pawn advance leaves a wake of weakened squares. The more advanced
b-pawn can also be undermined.} 14...f5 ( {If Black preferred to play on the
queenside, one approach might be} 14...a5 15.b5 Nb8 16.Qb3 Qd6 17.Na4 b6 18.O-O 
Nd7 $11 ) 15.Nb3 {White repositions her worst piece, always a good strategic
principle.} 15...Bf7 {anticipating a White Nc5.} 16.Rc1 ( 16.Nc5 {is still a
logical follow-up, as the knight cannot easily be forced to retreat. For
example} 16...b6 ( 16...Rb8 $5 ) 17.Na6 {and even though it is on the rim, the
Na6 is rather annoying for Black.} ) 16...a5 {this pawn break is now more
obvious, especially with the Nb3 as a potential target of the advancing pawn.} 
17.b5 Na7 18.a4 {this shuts down further advances by the a-pawn, but gives up
the diagonal to Black's bishop.} 18...b6 {Black decides to close off c5 before
doing anything else.} ( 18...Bb4 $5 ) ( 18...Rc8 $5 ) 19.Bh5 {White
overoptimistically tries to distract Black with play on the kingside. The bishop
of course cannot be exchanged without giving White an attack.} 19...g6 $15 
{however, with this simple move, which has no real drawbacks for Black, White
effectively loses a tempo and Black gains the initiative. The engine has shown a
small plus for Black for several moves; at this point it becomes more evident.} 
20.Be2 Qd6 {the queen occupies the best logical square for the knight currently
stuck on the rim (Na7-c8-d6). However, we will see there are compensations for
this.} 21.O-O h5 22.Qe1 Rae8 {this gets the rook into the game, so at least
there aren't two unproductive pieces on the a-file. However, it could be of more
use on the c-file, and eventually goes there.} 23.Nb1 {Black's space advantage
is now obviously seriously cramping White.} 23...Bd8 24.Rc2 Kg7 {getting the
king out of the way of the rook, so it can go to the h-file. This could also
have been played a move earlier.} 25.Qc1 Rh8 {White now faces a serious problem
on the h-file and the kingside in general, with Black threatening to advance
...h4 and crack open his position.} 26.f4 $6 {White probably did not want to be
squeezed to death and tries to get some space here. Unfortunately the resulting
opening of the position is better exploited by Black.} 26...exf3 27.Rxf3 Qb4 
$17 28.N3d2 Bg5 {the bishop finally gets active.} 29.Nf1 {White's structure at
this point is simply awful, with doubled g-pawns and a backward e-pawn that
desperately needs protection. All White has going for her at this point is the
c-file, which however can be easily challenged by Black.} 29...Rc8 ( 29...Qxa4 
{is also possible, but pawn snatching is not necessary for Black to further
improve her position.} ) 30.Rxc8 ( 30.Nc3 $5 {would put up stronger resistance.} 
) 30...Rxc8 31.Qd1 {now Black controls the c-file as well, with additional
threats after her next move.} 31...Qb2 $19 32.Qd3 Rc1 ( 32...Rc2 {would have
been my natural preference, establishing the threat on the second rank, and is
still winning; the text move is more effective, however.} ) 33.Nd2 Rc3 34.Qb1 
Qa3 35.Qe1 Rc1 36.Qf2 Qxa4 {collecting the pawn is perhaps the simplest way
forward and an easy decision before the time control.} 37.Bd3 Be6 {wisely
stifling any counterplay involving a sacrifice on f5.} 38.Qe2 ( 38.Bxf5 Bxf5 
39.Rxf5 gxf5 40.Qxf5 Be7 41.Qe5+ Bf6 42.Qxd5 Nc8 $19 ) 38...Qb4 ( 38...Qd1 
{would head for a simplified and won endgame, but Black prefers to keep up the
pressure in the middlegame.} ) 39.Kh2 a4 {passed pawns must be pushed!} 40.Rf2 
a3 41.Nf3 Bf6 42.Nh4 Bxh4 {well worth exchanging at this point, as the bishop
was not doing much otherwise and it eliminates a possible attacker.} 43.gxh4 
Bd7 {going for the obvious b5 target.} 44.Qf3 Qd6+ 45.Ng3 Nxb5 {at this point
it's hard to see how Black could possibly lose, although White perhaps was
pinning some hope on a sacrificial kingside breakthrough.} 46.Qe2 Nc7 ( 
46...Qe7 {would be an elegant tactical way of meeting the threat, with the idea
being ...Qxh4 followed by Qxg3.} ) 47.Qd2 Rc6 {Black over the next few moves
sorts out her pieces and then finally gets her queenside pawns moving, which
decides the game.} 48.Rf4 Ne6 ( 48...b5 {immediately is more effective, as White
cannot stop the next move to b4 and Black puts more pressure on her opponent
immediately. It is instructive to note, however, that Black having built up such
a positional advantage can take the time to sort her pieces - especially the
knight - while keeping her winning advantage in hand.} ) 49.Rf3 Rc8 50.Kg1 Nf8 
51.Qf2 Rc1+ 52.Kh2 Nh7 53.Qd2 Rc7 54.Kg1 Nf6 55.Ne2 b5 56.Bb1 b4 57.Qd3 Ne4 
{the knight, after many moves, reaches a dominant square and then deals the
final blow. Black surely planned to play ...Nc3 next, but White now offers a
better target.} 58.Qb3 Nd2 0-1
