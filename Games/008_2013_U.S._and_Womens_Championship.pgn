1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 c5 3.Nf3 Nc6 {while the move order is unusual, the line of the
Symmetrical English with ...e5 is popular at high levels.} 4.g3 f5 {this pawn
thrust, however, is not. The usual step here is for Black to fianchetto his
dark-square bishop, as shown by this top-level clash between Kramnik and
Carlsen.} ( 4...g6 5.Bg2 Bg7 6.O-O Nge7 7.a3 a5 8.Ne1 d6 9.Nc2 O-O 10.d3 Rb8

...e4.} 5...Be7 {usual is ... Nf6 here, retaining some flexibility for the
bishop.} 6.Bg2 Nf6 7.O-O O-O {at this point White has a classic English
formation, used most often against a KID setup or a closed formation with the
...f5 advance. Black has changed things up by playing ...c5, with more of a lock
on b4 and d4, but also leaving behind a big hole on d5, which is the key square
in the English for White.} 8.a3 Rb8 9.Rb1 {pursuing the standard queenside
expansion idea of pushing the b-pawn. Note that the lack of a fianchettoed
bishop on g7 means that White does not have to worry about protecting the Nc3,
among other things. The text move is a novelty according to the database, but
there are only two other games with this position, so perhaps it's not so much
of a surprise.} 9...Qe8 $14 {Houdini awards White a slight edge. White's pieces
are certainly better coordinated and she enjoys a slight lead in development,
along with good prospects on the queenside.} 10.Nd5 {a somewhat paradoxical
aspect of the English in general is the willingness of White to play what
appears to be a premature knight sally to d5, inviting an exchange and doubling
his d-pawns. In practical terms, however, the d5 pawn can seriously cramp Black
while the newly half-open c-file offers White good opportunities for pressuring
Black while employing a minority attack using the a- and b-pawns.} 10...Bd6 ( 
10...Nxd5 {is also a bad idea in this specific position for tactical reasons,
because the Nc6 gets chased off and there is no Bg7 to protect the e5 pawn.} 
11.cxd5 Nd4 12.Nxe5 ) 11.e4 {Krush chooses to play in the center rather than on
the queenside.} ( 11.b4 Nxd5 12.cxd5 Nd4 13.Re1 {would be the more standard way
to play. A possible continuation would be} 13...f4 14.Nd2 fxg3 15.hxg3 cxb4 
16.Ne4 $14 ) 11...b5 12.Nxf6+ Rxf6 13.exf5 Rxf5 {the last sequence did away with
Black's f-pawn, which often plays a key role in Black's kingside attack in these
types of positions. The half-open f-file may look dangerous, but Blacks threats
there are more easily neutralized by White. Also note the continuing lack of
coordination among Black's pieces.} 14.Ng5 ( 14.cxb5 {is Houdini's preference,
exchanging prior to making the knight thrust. The engine assesses that letting
Black exchange first and then plant a knight on d4 leads to equality.} 
14...Rxb5 {the presence of the hanging rook on b5 subsequently allows the threat
of Qg4-c4+ forking rook and king.} 15.Ng5 {and now} 15...Be7 {doesn't work for
tactical reasons:} 16.Qg4 Nd4 17.Bd5+ Kh8 18.Qxf5 Nxf5 19.Nf7+ Qxf7 ( 19...Kg8 
20.Nd6+ Kf8 21.Nxe8 Kxe8 22.Re1 Nd4 23.Rxe5 ) 20.Bxf7 $16 ) 14...Be7 15.Ne4 $11 
{White's immediate threats have evaporated and it's back to positional
maneuvering.} ( 15.Qg4 {is a tactical way to play and is still good for White,
but not nearly as threatening as in the above variation.} 15...Rf8 {here Black
can simply retreat the rook, for example.} 16.Bd5+ Kh8 17.Nxh7 d6 18.Qe4 Bf5 
19.Qg2 Bxh7 20.Bxc6 ) 15...Ba6 16.Nc3 ( 16.cxb5 Bxb5 17.Nc3 ) 16...Kh8 ( 
16...bxc4 {would seem to preempt White's threats on the queenside.} ) 17.cxb5 
Bxb5 18.Nxb5 Rxb5 $14 19.Bxc6 {White chooses to give up the strong Bg2 and the
bishop pair for longer-term compensation in the form of the doubled c-pawns.} ( 
19.Be3 $5 ) 19...dxc6 20.Bd2 Qd7 21.Bc3 {as is common in some of these
variations, White's dark-square bishop takes a long time to be developed. Here
Krush finds an excellent place for it.} 21...Rb8 22.Qe2 Qd5 23.f3 ( 23.Qe4 
{White is clearly not afraid of an endgame, given Black's weaknesses, and this
would immediately and powerfully centralize her queen, forcing Black to lose a
tempo because of the attack on the hanging Rf5.} ) 23...Bd6 24.Kg2 Kg8 25.Qe4 
Rbf8 26.Rbe1 {White simply ratchets up the pressure in the center, at no cost to
herself. Black meanwhile is barely defending and cannot generate counterplay.} 
26...h5 27.h4 Qxe4 $16 {Black decides to reduce the pressure and heads into a
major and minor piece ending, where White however has all the chances.} 28.dxe4 
R5f7 29.Rd1 Bc7 30.Rd3 {deliberately provoking the lead c-pawn's advance,
further weakening Black's formation.} 30...c4 31.Rd2 a5 {using a prophylactic
move to prevent Bb4, after which White further dominates the position.} 32.a4 
Kh7 33.Rc2 Rb8 34.Rff2 Bb6 35.Rfe2 Rbf8 $2 {Houdini pegs this as the losing
move. Black likely foresaw a positional crush and decided to deliberately
imbalance the position in the hopes of generating some practical counterplay
chances.} ( 35...Re8 ) 36.Bxe5 Rxf3 37.Bf4 $16 {White now has a comfortable
plus, with material gain coming soon.} ( 37.Bd6 {is the more aggressive line
preferred by Houdini, leveraging the passed pawn to good effect.} 37...R8f7 
38.e5 Rd3 39.Rxc4 ( 39.e6 {is also possible} ) 39...Rd7 40.Rxc6 $18 ) 37...Rb3 
38.Rxc4 {the weakened pawn is now snapped off.} 38...Rf6 39.Be5 Rg6 40.Bc3 Bc7 
{Black has too many weaknesses and cannot stop the e-pawn while protecting the
rest of her position.} 41.Re3 Be5 42.Rc5 Bxc3 43.bxc3 Rb2+ 44.Kh3 Kh6 45.e5 Re6 
46.Rxa5 Ra2 47.Ra8 Kg6 48.a5 c5 49.a6 Raxa6 50.Rxa6 Rxa6 51.e6 Ra8 52.g4 {an
excellent move, the purposes of which is to activate her king.} 52...hxg4+ 
53.Kxg4 Re8 54.c4 Kf6 {this looks good for Black, but Krush has correctly
calculated the resulting pawn ending as a win for White.} 55.e7 Rxe7 56.Rxe7 
Kxe7 57.Kf5 Kf7 58.h5 Kg8 59.Ke5 Kh7 60.Kd5 Kh6 61.Kxc5 Kxh5 62.Kd5 {and after
both pawns promote, White is ahead a tempo and can play Qh8+ followed by Qg8+ to
skewer the king against the unprotected Qg1. If Black does not go for the pawn
race, then White queens anyway.} 1-0
