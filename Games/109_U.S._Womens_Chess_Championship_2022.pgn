1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 Bf5 4.c4 c6 {by transposition, we now have the "Slow
Slav"} 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nh4 Bg6 ( 6...Be4 {was played in the previously analyzed game
from this tournament. I prefer it because it is more active and normally forces
f2-f3.} ) 7.Be2 Be7 {this could be viewed as prematurely committing the bishop,
with ...Nbd7 being by far the most played here.} 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qc2 {White scores
very well in the database from here, over 80 percent.} 9...Qc7 {taking advantage
of the open h-file to pressure h2, however this is easily frustrated by} 10.g3 
Nbd7 {finally getting the knight developed.} 11.Bd2 {and now White develops her
final minor piece. Black has to decide on her strategy at this point, and
chooses something very unusual.} 11...g5 {Perhaps this was more of a waiting
move, to see what White would commit to first. Later the g-pawn actually becomes
useful when White allows Black too much leeway on the h-file.} ( 11...O-O 
{would be a standard approach, followed by playing for exchanges in the center.} 
) ( 11...dxc4 {immediately, similar to what occurred in the previously analyzed
game, also looks good and perhaps more active for Black.} ) 12.O-O {this is safe
for the moment and not a bad choice, but White should watch out for ideas by
Black to be able to attack using the h-file, as in fact happens later.} 
12...dxc4 13.e4 $6 {White is not yet positioned to adequately support this
attempt to control the center, so Black's counter-thrust is more impactful.} 
13...e5 14.d5 {essentially forced, otherwise Black exchanges on d4 and then has
the ...c5 and ...Ne5 ideas.} 14...Nb6 {dominating d5 and protecting the c4 pawn.
This leaves the g5 pawn hanging, but White chooses not to take it, which was
probably simplest for equality.} 15.dxc6 $6 Qc8 $1 {while not yet winning, this
is much more effective than recapturing on c6, as now the queen threatens to go
to h3.} 16.Bf3 $6 ( 16.g4 {was necessary, as the engine points out.} ) 16...Qh3 
$19 17.Rfe1 {the king needs space to run after ...Qxh2.} 17...bxc6 {h2 cannot be
defended and White's king cannot move, so Black calmly recaptures.} 18.Be3 
{putting the bishop on a better diagonal for defense and opening up the 2nd rank
for the Qc2.} 18...Nfd7 $6 {this delays Black's attack too long and allows White
to insert a good defensive move. It also removes from the action a potentially
excellent attacking piece for Black. It does allow the Be7 to protect the g5
pawn, which perhaps was why it was played.} ( 18...Qxh2+ 19.Kf1 Qh3+ 20.Bg2 Qh5 
{now Black has the threat of ...Ng4 with an excellent attack.} ) 19.Na4 Qxh2+ 
20.Kf1 Qh3+ 21.Bg2 Qe6 {the best square for the queen, as the attack has spent
itself and Black needs to cover the c4 pawn and central squares. White should
now be able to recover at least one of the pawns and can think about
counterplay, although she is still a little worse off.} 22.Rac1 $15 f6 {this
gives the king an immediate bolt-hole on f7, but weakens the light squares
complex.} ( 22...g6 $5 {is recommended by the engine, covering more squares on
the defense of the kingside.} ) 23.Red1 $10 {White's threatens counterplay down
the d- and c-files.} 23...Kf7 24.a3 ( 24.Nxb6 {appears more straightforward for
White.} 24...Nxb6 25.a4 c3 26.Qxc3 Nxa4 27.Qc2 Nb6 28.Qxc6 Qxc6 29.Rxc6 {with
compensation for still being a pawn down, as White has the two bishops and more
active rooks. Compare with the main game and White clearly has more scope for
her pieces.} ) 24...Nxa4 {Black goes for simplification.} 25.Qxa4 Nb6 26.Bxb6 
axb6 27.Qxc4 Qxc4+ 28.Rxc4 c5 {simplifying Black's tasks at hand, although
locking in the bishop.} 29.Rc3 {White wants to give her rook more room to
maneuver, but this would allow Black to lock up the kingside and the Bg2
further.} ( 29.Bf3 {would keep the bishop active, regardless of Black's next.} 
) 29...b5 ( 29...g4 $5 ) 30.Rcd3 g4 {now Black finds and executes the bishop
restriction idea, but White has better rooks than before.} 31.f3 $6 {the general
idea of breaking the bishop out is correct, but before White's 3 pawns were
successfully containing Black's 4 on the kingside. This exchange results in a
weak structure for White.} ( 31.Rd7 ) 31...gxf3 {immediately taking advantage of
this, but White's structure would be so bad after taking on g4 that Black can
afford to do other things first.} ( 31...Kg6 32.fxg4 b4 33.axb4 cxb4 34.Rd7 Bc5 
$17 {is one illustrative line.} ) ( 31...b4 $5 ) 32.Bxf3 g6 {with the idea of
supporting an eventual advance of the f-pawn.} 33.Kg2 b4 {this move now has less
impact than it would have earlier.} 34.axb4 cxb4 35.R1d2 {conservatively
guarding the b-pawn.} ( 35.Rd7 Rhd8 {is still fine for White, since if all the
rooks get swapped, White should have no problem holding a draw in the
opposite-colored bishop endgame.} ) 35...Ra1 {the active choice.} 36.Bd1 
{correctly blocking the first rank. Now Black gets a bit of initiative,
however.} 36...f5 37.Rf3 {pinning the f-pawn.} 37...Bg5 38.Rd7+ Ke6 39.Rfd3 Be7 
{the only move, guarding the d6 square. White continues to hold the balance
through her rook activity, despite being a pawn down with worse structure.} ( 
39...fxe4 $4 40.Bg4+ Kf6 41.R3d6# ) 40.Rb7 $2 {this however would allow Black to
simply win, now that there is no mate possibility.} ( 40.exf5+ gxf5 41.g4 fxg4 
42.Bxg4+ Kf7 {and White should draw.} ) 40...Kf6 $2 {missing the breakthrough
chance.} ( 40...fxe4 $1 41.Bg4+ ( 41.Bb3+ Kf5 $19 ) 41...Kf6 42.Re3 Bc5 43.Rxe4 
Rg1+ $19 ) 41.Rb6+ Kg5 {correctly advancing on the kingside, rather than staying
passive defending.} 42.Rb5 Rb1 {preferring to trade the e- for b-pawns.} 
43.Rxe5 Rxb2+ 44.Kf3 Bf6 45.Red5 Bc3 {a safe choice to guard the b-pawn.} 
46.exf5 gxf5 {with opposite-colored bishops and both rooks on the the board,
this should still be a draw for White, but it's of course easier to play for
Black.} 47.Re3 Rh1 48.Be2 Rh2 {while this looks threatening, there's nothing
Black can actually do, since White has everything covered. Until the next move,
that is.} 49.Rd1 $2 ( 49.Re8 ) 49...Bf6 {missing another breakthrough chance.} 
( 49...Bd2 $1 {is spotted by the engine. The problem is that White's king is
boxed in and the Re3 cannot leave the 3rd rank.} 50.Rd3 Bc1 51.Rxc1 Rbxe2 
{without the opposite-colored bishops on the board, it is now won for Black, who
has the outside passed pawn.} 52.Rf1 Ra2 $19 ) 50.Re8 Rb3+ 51.Re3 Rxe3+ {double
rooks are typically better for drawing, so an exchange benefits Black's
practical chances to win.} 52.Kxe3 Be5 {posing White diffficulties that she
fails to solve.} 53.Rb1 $2 ( 53.Rd8 Bxg3 54.Rg8+ $10 ) 53...Bd6 $19 {the simple
winning continuation. White cannot threaten the b-pawn, while Black will
eventually get the g-pawn, which is stuck on a dark square.} 54.Kf3 Bc5 
{creating a mating threat on f2.} 55.Rf1 b3 {the principle of two weaknesses in
action. White can (barely) cover her kingside pawn and the mating square, but
that leaves the queenside open.} 56.Bd3 b2 ( 56...Rd2 {would put White in
zugzwang after} 57.Bb1 Bd4 ) 57.Bb1 Rd2 58.Ba2 Bb6 59.Bb1 Bd4 60.Ba2 Rd3+ 
61.Kg2 Be5 62.Rf3 Rd1 {threatening to advance the b-pawn.} ( 62...Rxf3 $2 
63.Kxf3 {and the opposite-colored bishops force a draw after White goes Bb1.} ) 
63.Rf1 Rxf1 64.Kxf1 Kg4 {now the g-pawn falls without Black having to give up
anything.} 65.Bb1 Bxg3 {White can resign now.} 66.Ke2 f4 67.Ba2 f3+ 68.Ke3 ( 
68.Kf1 Kf4 $19 ) 68...Bh4 69.Bb1 Kg3 70.Be4 Bg5+ 71.Kd4 {...f2 72. Bd3 b1(Q) and
Black queens one of the pawns.} 0-1
