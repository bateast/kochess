1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 e6 4.e3 f5 {naturally Black has several options here;
Zatonskih goes for a Stonewall.} 5.Nc3 Nf6 6.Bd3 Bd6 {the Modern Stonewall
formation is now complete.} 7.O-O O-O 8.Qc2 Ne4 9.Ne5 Nd7 {this is the most
popular continuation and scores 50 percent for Black in the database. Black
chooses to avoid exchanging off her dark-square bishop.} ( 9...Bxe5 10.dxe5 Nd7 
{is an alternative line that scores better than 50 percent for Black.} ) 10.f3 
Nef6 {a rare move.} ( 10...Nxc3 {is by far the most played here, for example} 
11.Qxc3 Nxe5 12.dxe5 Be7 13.Bd2 Qb6 14.Kh1 Bd7 15.Rad1 Kh8 16.Bc1 Be8 17.Bb1 
Bh5 18.a3 a5 19.Rd4 g5 20.Re1 g4 21.fxg4 Bxg4 22.h3 Bh5 23.Rf1 Bg5 24.b4 axb4 
25.axb4 c5 26.Rd2 cxb4 27.Qb3 Bxe3 28.Rc2 Bxc1 29.Rfxc1 Ra3 30.Qb2 d4 31.c5 Qc6 
32.Qxd4 Rxh3+ 33.Kg1 Rg8 34.Rf2 Rhg3 35.Rcc2 Bf3 {0-1 (35) Nazarov,V
(2152)-Nagimov,A (2344) Dagomys 2004} ) 11.Nxd7 ( 11.f4 {would be more usual
here, keeping the Ne5 established on its square.} ) 11...Bxd7 12.e4 $6 {this
greatly assists Black's typical plan of opening the f-file for attacking
purposes.} ( 12.b3 {would be a standard way to develop the bishop} ) ( 12.c5 $5 
) 12...fxe4 13.fxe4 e5 {posing a complex choice for White in the center.} ( 
13...Ng4 {is Houdini's move, with an immediate threat to the h2 pawn.} 14.Rxf8+ 
Qxf8 15.g3 dxc4 16.Bxc4 {and now} 16...Bc5 {is the key tactic, gaining Black the
d-pawn, since} 17.dxc5 $2 Qxc5+ 18.Kg2 Qxc4 $19 ) 14.exd5 {the engine indicates
this is the incorrect selection.} ( 14.c5 exd4 15.cxd6 dxc3 16.Be3 $11 Qe8 ( 
16...cxb2 $6 17.Qxb2 {and now White threatens the pawn on b7 and pushing e5.} ) 
) 14...exd4 15.Ne4 Nxe4 16.Rxf8+ Qxf8 17.Bxe4 h6 {Black takes a moment to move
the pawn out of the B+Q battery.} ( 17...Qf6 {as a more aggressive continuation
was also possible, accelerating Black's threats to White's vulnerable king. For
example} 18.Bxh7+ $2 Kh8 19.Bd3 Re8 20.Bd2 Qh4 21.g3 Bxg3 $19 ) 18.Bd2 Re8 
{Houdini again likes ...Qf6 here.} 19.Re1 Kh8 {getting out of the way of future
potential checks along the g8-a2 diagonal following an exchange on d5, as well
as Bh7+.} 20.Qd3 Qf6 21.Qf3 ( 21.dxc6 {would ensure that Black' s queenside
pawns are split in the coming endgame.} ) 21...Qe5 22.g3 Rf8 23.Qg2 Qh5 24.Rf1 
Rxf1+ 25.Qxf1 c5 {the engine evaluates the position as completely equal, not
surprising given its symmetry.} 26.Bc2 Kg8 27.Qd3 Kf7 {Black decides to get her
king closer to the center before offering an exchange of queens.} 28.Qe4 Qg4 
29.Qxg4 Bxg4 {somewhat paradoxically, with the queens off it makes it more
difficult for White in practical terms. Now Zatonskih gives a lesson in how to
play bishop endings.} 30.Kf2 Kf6 31.Bd3 g5 32.Bf1 {this withdrawal allows Black
to immediately seize a key diagonal.} 32...Bf5 33.Be2 Be4 34.h3 b5 {a
provocative move that appears to have rattled her opponent.} 35.b3 ( 35.cxb5 
Bxd5 36.b3 {and now Black cannot penetrate on the queenside.} ) 35...b4 36.Bd1 
Bb1 {the move that seals White's fate.} 37.Bc1 Bxa2 38.Bc2 a5 39.Bb2 Be5 40.Bd1 
a4 41.bxa4 Bxc4 42.Bf3 d3 43.Bc1 b3 0-1
