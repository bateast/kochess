1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 
9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3 e6 11.Bf4 {White's first significant decision in the main
line of the Classical Caro-Kann. The alternative, Bd2, prevents Black's next,
but has been considered less challenging.} 11...Qa5+ 12.Bd2 {in olden times, the
expected result would have been for Black to retreat with ...Qc7 and enter into
more standard lines, rendering the Bf4/Bd2 decision essentially meaningless. GMs
since the early 2000s have played this position more actively, however.} 
12...Bb4 {Black has a remarkable plus score (almost 54 percent) in the database
after this move.} 13.a3 {this move is the third most played, but relatively
rare. It essentially offers a transition to an equal ending and should therefore
be viewed as a drawing attempt for White.} ( 13.c3 {is standard, after which
Black does best to retreat with} 13...Be7 ) ( 13.Ne4 $5 {starts off
complications if Black does not wish to trade pieces, starting with} 13...Ngf6 
14.Nd6+ Ke7 ) 13...Bxd2+ 14.Qxd2 {at this point, Black scores well in the
database both by trading queens or by keeping them on with either ...Qc7 or .
..Qd5.} 14...Qxd2+ {So opts to head straight for the ending, having over 400 Elo
points on his opponent and no doubt both greater experience and endgame skills.} 
15.Nxd2 Ngf6 16.O-O-O {castling kingside would decentralize the king and leave
the h-pawn weakened after the rook transfer, so White castles queenside.} 
16...Ke7 {Black feels no need to castle at all. The king is centralized for the
coming endgame, covering the d6 square, and the rooks are connected.} 17.Nde4 
{re-developing the knight, uncovering the Rd1 and offering another piece trade.} 
17...Rad8 {So develops the rook and implicitly declares he will be using it on
the d-file, pursuing a central strategy.} 18.Rhe1 Nxe4 {So decides to simplify
the task at hand, now that White has shifted his kingside rook over. This means
that Black would gain a small initiative in the event of of a knight recapture.} 
19.Rxe4 ( 19.Nxe4 Nf6 {now the h-pawn is threatened.} 20.Nxf6 gxf6 {and after
...Rhg8 Black will have a pleasant, if small, advantage in his rook activity.
The doubled f-pawns are not a weakness that White can exploit and in fact help
shore up Black's central control (e5 and e6 squares).} ) 19...Nf6 {the knight
goes to its best square with a tempo on the rook.} 20.Re5 {on the 5th rank the
rook guards the h-pawn and is not badly placed, so Black harrasses it again.} 
20...Ng4 {also threatening f2.} 21.Re2 {retreating and protecting the f2 pawn at
the same time.} 21...Rd5 {now it is Black's turn to influence the 5th rank with
a rook, provoking White's next.} 22.c4 Rd7 {the point of Black's maneuver was to
make the d-pawn a better target for him. The position remains equal, but is
easier to play for Black, who has more obvious targets (White's h- and
d-pawns).} 23.f3 {pushing back the advanced knight and removing the f-pawn from
its attack. This comes at the cost of the pawn's influence over g3 and e3.} ( 
23.Nf5+ {is the choice of the engines, taking advantage of the pin on the e-pawn
to drive the king away from its ideal square.} ) 23...Nf6 24.Re5 {reoccupying
the 5th rank, now that the rook cannot be driven away by the knight.} 24...Rc8 
{the king's rook finally gets into the game, So choosing to line it up against
his opponent's king. One potential idea that results is the ...b5 pawn advance.} 
25.Nf5+ {now White chooses to drive Black's king back. However, this is not as
effective now, since the rook formerly on h8 has found freedom on the other side
of the board.} 25...Kf8 26.Ne3 Rcd8 {a simple but effective doubling of rooks
against the d-pawn.} 27.Nc2 {with White's pieces more awkwardly placed and
restricted, Black by this point has a slightly more concrete edge than simply
enjoying an easier position.} 27...b6 {increasing Black's control of the 5th
rank and preventing ideas of Ra5, for example. At this point Black can be said
to have the initiative as well, since White is running out of useful moves and
will have to respond to Black's ideas.} 28.Rde1 {taking advantage of the fact
that the knight is anchoring the pawn on d2, also removing the under-protected
rook from any potential tactics involving the d-file.} 28...Rd6 {this
potentially frees up the d7 square for the knight and provokes White's next
move. These types of ideas can be difficult for amateurs to spot. Often we look,
in a too-narrow fashion, to always "do something" with the piece being moved. In
this case, the rook itself is no better off on d6, but it accomplishes something
useful for Black's other pieces.} 29.c5 Rd5 {So was evidently fine with allowing
a trade of rooks. From a practical standpoint, a player with stronger technique
usually finds it easier to win a single rather than double rook ending. This
move further pressures the h5 pawn, so White is forced to deal with that threat
over the next couple of moves.} ( 29...R6d7 {also looks good, maintaining the
tension on the d-file. The square d5 is now also available for the knight.} ) 
30.cxb6 {White chooses not to exchange rooks and by doing so has to otherwise
reinforce or remove his pawns on the 5th rank.} ( 30.Rxd5 {is what the engines
advise.} 30...Nxd5 {here Black's knight is unassailable on d5 and clearly
superior to its counterpart, so White may not have liked that board picture when
calculating.} ) ( 30.g4 {played immediately lets Black gain positionally, after} 
30...R5d7 {followed by ... Nd5 and ...Ke7, centralizing the knight and king.} ) 
30...axb6 31.g4 R5d6 $15 {clearing d5 for the knight and keeping the rook on the
6th rank to defend the pawns from potential attack.} 32.b4 {gaining space on the
queenside and helping blockade c5.} 32...Nd5 {at this point, simply comparing
the Black and White knights' scope for action shows why the engines show a
noticeable (if not yet decisive) edge for Black.} 33.Kb2 {advancing the king
towards the action and clearing the first rank for potential rook moves.} 
33...Nf4 {the better knight begins to make its presence felt, forcing White to
respond to the fork threat on d3.} 34.R1e3 f6 {the engines prefer the idea of
...b5 here. However, squeezing White's rook has a certain appeal to it and So
uses this to open the d-file.} 35.R5e4 e5 {now White has no choice.} 36.dxe5 
Nd3+ 37.Kc3 {this intuitive-looking move, centralizing the king rather than
moving it to the edge, in fact offers So a way to further imbalance the
position.} ( 37.Ka2 {is the engines' choice.} ) 37...fxe5 {similar to White's
previous setup with his d-pawn, now Black's knight supports a central pawn
against the pressure of two rooks. The difference is that Black's knight is much
better placed than White's was, and Black's rooks are more dangerous. As we will
see shortly, there is also a tactical point to the e-pawn's newly-won control of
d4.} 38.a4 $2 {under pressure, White goes wrong. With this move, he evidently
thought that the situation in the center was stable.} ( 38.Kb3 {and now Black no
longer has the idea of a Nf2-d1 maneuver with check.} ) 38...Nf2 $1 {now White
loses material, since the Black e-pawn prevents the Re4 from escaping the
knight's attack and covering the d1 square with Rd4.} 39.Rxe5 Nd1+ 40.Kc4 Nxe3+ 
41.Rxe3 $17 {White has a pawn for the exchange, but with R+N versus a strong two
rooks, this is not enough.} 41...Rd5 {first shutting down potential White
counterplay involving a queenside pawn advance. White's king is much more active
than Black's, so allowing White to get a queenside passed pawn would be
dangerous.} 42.Rc3 {lining up on the Black c-pawn.} 42...Kf7 43.Ne3 {White has
done a good job of reactivating the knight, but So can temporarily ignore it to
resolve the situation on the queenside, while his Rd5 is still dominant.} 
43...b5+ {Black uses White's advanced king placement against him, forcing a pawn
exchange.} 44.axb5 ( 44.Kb3 bxa4+ 45.Kxa4 Rd3 $17 ) 44...cxb5+ 45.Kb3 Rd3 
{Black presses his advantage, keeping up maximum pressure on White's pieces.} 
46.Nf5 Kf6 {the dominating placement of Black's pair of rooks means that he
should avoid exchanging one, until he can get something concrete for it.} 
47.Kc2 Rd2+ {the next sequences forces the White king away and keeps Black's
rooks dominant.} 48.Kc1 Rd1+ 49.Kc2 R8d2+ 50.Kb3 Rd3 {White would now lose the
f-pawn with a rook exchange. Note how Black has no interest in allowing any
White attempts at counterplay.} 51.Ne3 Rb1+ {forcing the next sequence.} 52.Kc2 
Rxc3+ 53.Kxc3 Ke5 {although the material balance is the same, Black effectively
dominates the center (and White's knight) with his king. White's weak pawns are
now more vulnerable as well.} 54.Nf5 Rf1 {Black is not afraid to trade pawns in
this manner, since the rook will clean up on the kingside before White can do
anything useful.} 55.Nxg7 Rxf3+ 56.Kd2 {note how White's king was effectively
"boxed out" of the center and is essentially out of the action.} 56...Kf4 
{going after the g-pawn next. Black only needs to keep one pawn on the board, as
White will then not be able to overcome Black's K+R combo, who can keep the
knight and king away from it.} 57.Nf5 ( 57.Ne6+ {does not help, as after} 
57...Kxg4 58.Nd4 Rf7 59.Nxb5 Rb7 {with ...Rxb4 to follow, along with the fall of
the h5 pawn.} ) 57...Kxg4 58.Nxh6+ {a desperate attempt to eliminate Black's
pawns, but now the knight will be trapped.} 58...Kxh5 59.Ng8 Rf7 0-1
