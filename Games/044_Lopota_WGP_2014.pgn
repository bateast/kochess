1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 {this enters into the complex of formations known as
the Closed English.} 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.Rb1 {this accelerated rook development has
become more common, as White's obvious plan is to push the b-pawn. Often White
defers kingside development in this line, which is the point of the accelerated
version, but in this game the opening heads back into more traditional
channels.} 5...a5 6.e3 {indicating that the king's knight will be developed to
e2, a more defensive position than f3 that also leaves the Bg2 unobstructed.} ( 
6.a3 {continuing with the idea of b2-b4 is more common here, scoring 56 percent
in the database.} ) 6...Nf6 7.Nge2 O-O 8.d3 d6 9.O-O Be6 {fighting for the key
d5 square.} 10.Nd5 {a thematic move in the English; White is not afraid of a
trade on d5, which would give her an excellently placed pawn and the two
bishops. (...Nxd5 cannot be played due to the resulting pawn fork of c6 and e6)} 
10...Qd7 {connecting the rooks and preparing to try and trade off the Bg2.} 
11.Nec3 {significantly improving the knight and reinforcing d5.} 11...Nd8 
{Black has a number of possibilities here and can choose to play on the
queenside, kingside or in the center. Here she decides to exchange off two minor
pieces and reposition the knight on the kingside following ...f5.} 12.Bd2 Nxd5 
13.cxd5 Bh3 14.Bxh3 {while this looks positionally suspect, allowing the Black
queen into the weak white-square complex, Black cannot exploit this
effectively.} ( 14.Qb3 {is an alternative approach, spending the tempo
developing the queen and ending up with a fianchettoed king.} 14...Bxg2 15.Kxg2 
f5 16.f3 ) 14...Qxh3 15.Qa4 {played apparently with the idea of pressuring the
a-pawn and complicating Black's defense on the queenside. However, Black is able
to proceed with her kingside plans.} ( 15.Rc1 $5 {would appear to generate more
immediate threats and opportunities for White on the c-file.} ) 15...f5 16.Nb5 
( 16.f3 {would maintain better control over White's potentially sensitive
kingside.} 16...Nf7 17.Ne2 ) 16...Nf7 $11 17.f4 ( 17.Nxc7 e4 18.f4 ( 18.Nxa8 $4 
Ng5 19.f4 Nf3+ 20.Rxf3 exf3 21.Kf2 Qg2+ 22.Ke1 Qe2# ) 18...exf3 19.Rxf3 Ne5 
20.Rf2 Nxd3 21.Rg2 $11 ) 17...Rfc8 {Black is now able to neutralize White's play
on the queenside.} 18.Rbc1 {now this has much less impact than it could have
previously on move 15.} ( 18.Qd1 $5 {with the idea of redeploying the queen to
be able to cover the kingside.} ) 18...c6 19.dxc6 bxc6 20.Nc3 {now White is not
worse, but the initiative has shifted to Black.} 20...exf4 21.Rxf4 $6 
{evidently White was looking to try and harass the Qh3, but this move would
allow Black to get an advantage.} ( 21.exf4 $11 ) 21...Ne5 {now the knight
happily occupies the central square and threatens to go to g4.} 22.Nd1 Qh5 
{this lets up the immediate pressure and allows White to adjust. The threatened
penetration of the queen to e2 can be contained.} ( 22...Ng4 {immediately looks
very good.} 23.Rf2 f4 {giving the Qh3 a retreat path along the diagonal.} 
24.exf4 Nxf2 25.Nxf2 Qe6 $15 ) 23.Bc3 Qe2 24.Qb3+ d5 25.Bxe5 {White is happy to
exchange off the threatening, centralized knight.} 25...Bxe5 26.Rf2 {now the
correct path for Black becomes more complicated and she goes astray.} 26...Qg4 
$2 {apparently missing the next deflection tactic.} ( 26...Qe1+ 27.Kg2 Qb4 $11 
) 27.Rxc6 Rd8 {the better defensive option, maintaining the central pawn.} ( 
27...Rxc6 28.Qxd5+ Kg7 29.Qxc6 $16 ) 28.d4 $16 Rab8 29.Qd3 Bg7 30.Rc5 {White can
now calmly go about exploiting her material and positional advantage. Note how
the Nd1 and Rf2 may look awkwardly placed, but in fact they hold the position
together and neutralize Black's potential counterplay.} 30...h5 {Black evidently
believes that she is lost and decides to try and force some counterplay, in the
hopes that White will make a mistake.} 31.Rxa5 $18 {a simple and strong
response.} 31...Bh6 32.Qe2 Qe4 33.Qf3 Qd3 34.Qe2 Qe4 {repetition of moves due to
time pressure, no doubt.} 35.Rc5 ( 35.Ra6 $5 ) 35...Re8 36.Qf3 Qd3 {Black has no
better ideas at this point.} 37.Kg2 Re4 38.Rxd5 ( 38.Qe2 {would now force the
queen exchange and simplify things for White.} ) 38...Rc8 {Black continues
playing for a swindle.} 39.Rc5 Rxc5 40.dxc5 Qc4 41.Nc3 Re5 ( 41...Rxe3 42.Qd5+ 
Qxd5+ 43.Nxd5 Rd3 44.Nb4 Rd4 45.Nc6 $18 ) 42.Qc6 Kh7 43.e4 h4 {Black's last
gasp.} ( 43...Qxc5 44.Qxc5 Rxc5 45.exf5 gxf5 46.a4 $18 ) 44.exf5 gxf5 45.Qd7+ 
Bg7 46.c6 Qg4 47.Rf4 h3+ 48.Kf1 Qg6 49.Nd5 1-0
