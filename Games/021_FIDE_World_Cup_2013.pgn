1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c6 4.e3 Bd6 5.Bd3 f5 6.O-O Nf6 {we now have a Modern
Stonewall setup for Black. White, having been diverted from playing the usual
and more theoretically critical fianchetto with Bg2, now has a Colle-type
setup.} 7.b3 Qe7 {in order to preempt any White plans to exchange off the Bd6 by
playing Ba3.} 8.Ne5 {an aggressive and possibly premature move; Bb2 is normal
here, followed by additional piece development.} 8...O-O 9.Bb2 Bd7 {starting the
classical bishop maneuver to the kingside. The more modern development is with
...b6 and Bb7, but with the Ne5 and Bd3 placed where they are, this method of
developing the bishop would appear to be less effective.} 10.Nc3 Be8 11.cxd5 
cxd5 {knowing when to exchange central pawns is an art in the Stonewall. Here it
seems to work in Black's favor, as the central tension has been released and
White no longer has any threats there. White can try to obtain play down the
c-file, but Black will be able to defend easily enough.} 12.Rc1 Nc6 13.Nb5 Bb4 
14.a3 Ba5 15.Be2 {preventing ...Bh5 by Black and getting the bishop on to a more
useful diagonal in general.} 15...a6 16.Nc3 Ne4 {a thematic Stonewall move.
Black is happy to open the f-file for his rook if White exchanges on e4.
Similarly, if White played f3 to kick the knight, it would have a good square
waiting on g5, while the Be2 would be worse off.} 17.b4 Bc7 18.Nxe4 fxe4 {by
this point Black must have been very happy with his game. Although the engine
evaluation is even, Black has fully equalized and has accomplished his strategic
goals out of the opening. The initiative now passes to him.} 19.Qb3 {it's
unclear what this was intended to accomplish, beyond linking the rooks. The
queen turns out to be awkwardly placed and away from the developing kingside
action.} 19...Bxe5 20.dxe5 Qg5 21.Kh1 $6 {Perhaps White thought his opponent
would take the offered e5 pawn. Houdini recommends simply bringing the queen
back to d1, in order to prevent the next bishop move by Black.} 21...Bh5 ( 
21...Nxe5 $6 22.Rc7 {and White has compensation for the pawn, having regained
some initiative and counterplay on the queenside.} ) 22.f3 Qh6 $15 {Black can
choose when to exchange pawns, due to the pin against the hanging Be2.} 23.Rce1 
exf3 24.gxf3 Rf7 $17 {Black's play continues to flow naturally from the
position; doubling rooks on the f-file is possible, as is supporting the g-pawn
with a rook on g7 if it advances. Meanwhile, White struggles to do something
meaningful.} 25.Bc1 Bg6 {done in order to provide the queen with additional
squares on the h-file.} 26.e4 Qh3 27.exd5 Nd4 {Black rightly ignores the pawn
for the time being and switches over to active attack mode, having identified f3
as White's weak point.} 28.Qd1 Nxe2 29.Qxe2 Bh5 30.Kg1 {White has to avoid the
fork of king and queen.} 30...Bxf3 31.Qf2 Qg4+ 32.Qg3 Qxg3+ 33.hxg3 Bxd5 {Black
emerges from the middlegame struggle with an extra pawn for the endgame, which
he converts nicely.} 34.Be3 a5 35.b5 a4 36.Rxf7 Kxf7 37.Rf1+ Kg6 38.Rf4 h6 
39.Kf2 Bb3 40.Rg4+ Kh7 41.Rd4 Rc8 42.b6 Rc2+ 43.Ke1 Ra2 44.Bc1 Rg2 $19 45.Bf4
