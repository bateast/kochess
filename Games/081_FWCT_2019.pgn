1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Qe2 Nxe4 {Here Goryachkina follows my
path (in Annotated Game #212) of exchanging on e4, rather than Carlsen's
...Bf5.} 6.Qxe4 Qa5 {now Black diverges from my game, which had ... Nd7. This is
a rather new line, as my database games only go back to 2017.} ( 6...Qd5 $5 {is
also often played here.} ) 7.Bc4 {this would have been prevented by ...Qd5.
However, now we see Black's main idea behind the previous move.} ( 7.Qf4 {is the
engines' preference.} 7...Qf5 8.Qe3 Qe6 {followed by a queen exchange on e3 may
have been too drawish for Gunina as White, however.} ) 7...Bf5 8.Qe2 e6 ( 
8...Nd7 $5 {would control e5 and develop a piece.} ) 9.Ne5 {now White has a
potential sacrifice on f7 and also offers the c2 pawn, a theme that occurs in
some other Caro-Kann lines. Usually the c-pawn is not taken by Black, because it
loses too much time and can give White a strong attack. That is certainly the
case here, given the weakness of the e-pawn.} ( 9.O-O {was played in a rapid
game, the only other one in the database in this line.} 9...Be7 10.Bb3 Nd7

9...Bxc2 $2 10.Nxf7 $18 ) 10.c3 {preparing the d4 advance.} 10...Bf6 11.d4 Bxe5 
{Black considers that the exchange on e5 is better for her, although White now
has the two bishops. The strong knight disappears and development is now equal.} 
12.dxe5 Nd7 13.g4 {it's often difficult to evaluate an early g4 push. White
seems set on aggression and will be looking to gain space and pressure on the
kingside. Of course, now her own king won't be secure either.} ( 13.Bf4 {would
be a more standard choice.} ) 13...Bg6 14.f4 b5 {another thematic Caro-Kann
move, hitting the bishop and with the idea of further queenside expansion, when
possible.} 15.b4 {this in-between move stops a future ...b4, but allows Black to
relocate her queen with tempo to the now under-protected White kingside.} ( 
15.Bb3 $5 ) 15...Qd8 16.Bb3 Qh4+ 17.Kd1 ( 17.Qf2 Qxg4 18.Be3 $15 {is the
engines' line, limiting the damage, but must have been unappetizing for Gunina.} 
) 17...Rd8 ( 17...O-O-O {looks even better, getting Black's king to a
comparatively safer zone. White doesn't have time to play something like a4,
because of the Nxe5 threat.} ) 18.Bd2 h5 $17 {forcing the issue on the kingside.
Now White has to respond.} 19.f5 {White at this point is committed on the
kingside, so might as well press forward.} ( 19.g5 {doesn't solve anything, as
Black can take her time to further strengthen her position while White no longer
has any threats.} ) 19...exf5 20.e6 {Perhaps White's best practical chance,
forcing Black to find the one correct defense. Which, however, she does.} 
20...Nf6 21.exf7+ Kf8 22.Kc1 {breaking the pin. White has now run out of
possible counterplay, though, and Black takes over the initiative.} 22...Ne4 
23.Be1 Qg5+ 24.Kb2 hxg4 $19 {securing the advantage. Black's passed f-pawn is
now huge.} 25.a4 Bxf7 {Goryachkina chooses careful consolidation to preserve her
winning advantage. This also requires good calculation of the following
sequence.} ( 25...bxa4 {is the engine line, but that allows White more piece
activity and open lines with the light-squared bishop.} ) 26.Bxf7 Kxf7 27.axb5 
cxb5 28.Rxa7+ Kg6 29.Qxb5 {White temporarily restores material equality and has
her own pair of passed pawns, but her king position is too weak and Black
immediately exploits this.} ( 29.Ra6+ Nf6 $19 ) 29...Rd1 {pinning the bishop and
threatening ...Qc1+.} 30.Qc6+ Kh7 31.Qc7 Rg8 {overprotecting g7 before doing
anything else. Black is not in a rush and the move would eventually be necessary
anyway.} 32.Kb3 {nothing better.} 32...Rb1+ 33.Ka4 Qe3 {threatening to win the
Ra7 after ...Ra1+, as well as to capture the Be1, so forcing the win of
material.} 34.Kb5 Rxe1 35.Rxe1 Qxe1 36.c4 {White pins her last hopes on the
passed pawns.} 36...Nc3+ 37.Ka5 Qa1+ 38.Kb6 Qg1+ {Black here maneuvers her queen
to a central position to simultaneously pressure the White pawns and harass the
White king.} 39.Ka6 Qd4 40.Qf7 Qd6+ 41.Ka5 Qg6 {by this point, Goryachkina has
calculated the endgame win with the queens off the board, so would be happy to
exchange.} 42.Qd7 ( 42.Qxg6+ Kxg6 {and now one continuation would be} 43.b5 Rh8 
44.b6 Ne4 45.b7 Nc5 {the knight arrives just in time.} 46.Kb6 Nxb7 47.Rxb7 Rxh2 
$19 ) 42...Rf8 {a simple winning choice, just getting behind the passed pawn and
pushing it.} 43.c5 f4 44.Ra6 ( 44.c6 $2 {is not possible, due to the weakness of
White's king and the great combination Black's knight and queen can make.} 
44...Qg5+ {with a mate in 5.} ) ( 44.b5 {is just too slow.} 44...f3 $19 ) 
44...Qf5 45.Qd4 Qc2 46.Kb6 Rb8+ 47.Kc6 Qg2+ {and now White again loses material
after Kd7 followed by ...Qb7+, so she resigns.} 0-1
