1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 Bg4 5.h3 Bh5 6.cxd5 Bxf3 {the most popular and
best-scoring response. White's queen is diverted to the kingside as a result,
which lessens the impact of the bishop's absence from the queenside.} 7.Qxf3 
cxd5 8.Nc3 e6 9.Bd3 Bb4 $146 {...Nc6 is the normal move here. The dark-square
bishop typically goes to e7 or d6 rather than b4.} 10.Bd2 Nc6 11.O-O O-O 
12.Rfd1 Rc8 {a typical Slav middlegame structure is on the board, with a
symmetrical pawn structure and open c-file. White has the two bishops, but their
scope is relatively constrained.} 13.Qe2 Qe7 14.Rac1 Rfd8 15.a3 Ba5 16.b4 Bc7 
17.f4 Bd6 {at this point one has to question the wisdom of the bishop's long
journey to d6, when this could have been played directly on move 9. Black
shortly will use a pawn lever to break up White's queenside, so perhaps that was
her original strategic concept.} 18.Rb1 Ra8 19.Na4 a5 20.bxa5 {this release of
tension seems to favor Black's idea, rather than immediately pressing the chance
for a White advantage. Two potential alternatives:} ( 20.b5 ) ( 20.Nb6 ) 
20...Nxa5 21.Nb6 Ra7 22.a4 Ba3 {taking advantage of the Q+B battery.} ( 
22...Nc6 $5 ) 23.Bxa5 {this exchanges a bad bishop for a knight on the rim.
While not a bad idea in the short term, White does give up the one slim
long-term strategic advantage she has.} ( 23.Rb5 Nc6 24.Rdb1 $14 ) 23...Rxa5 
24.Qd2 Ra7 25.Qc2 Qf8 {keeps the Q+B battery active while lending the queen's
strength to the eigth rank.} 26.Rb3 g6 {breaks the indirect pin on the Nf6,
which otherwise was tied to defending h7. Also importantly prevents the f5
advance.} 27.Rdb1 Bd6 $11 {White's temporary pressure has ebbed and Black will
be able to easily parry White's further attempts at activity.} 28.Rc3 Bb4 
29.Rc7 Kg7 30.g4 Ba5 31.g5 Ne8 {although White has a space advantage and a rook
sitting on c7 (temporarily), it is interesting to note the lack of any real
threats. The Bd3 is effectively out of the game due to the pawn structure and
the rook cannot do anything with the c-file.} 32.Rc5 Nd6 33.Qd1 {White
apparently does not want to acknowledge her lack of threats and tries to regroup
her pieces. However, this works to Black's advantage.} 33...Bxb6 34.Rxb6 Rda8 
$15 {at this point, Black's knight is superior to White's bishop and Black's
pieces are cooperating much more effectively than White's.} 35.Rb4 Qe8 36.Bc2 
Nc4 {White's lack of piece coordination, especially with the rooks, is visibly
evident.} 37.Kf2 b6 {this allows White to return to equality.} ( 37...h6 {is the
engine's recommendation to try for an advantage.} 38.gxh6+ Kxh6 39.Rc7 b6 
40.Rxa7 Rxa7 $17 {Black can now target the isolated h-pawn and penetrate on the
kingside with his queen.} ) 38.Rcb5 Qd7 39.Qd3 $6 {this sets up a tactical
weakness on the c-file.} ( 39.Bd3 ) 39...Qc7 ( 39...Rc8 {in return for
sacrificing the b-pawn, Black gains control of the c-file and can penetrate to
the back ranks.} 40.Bb3 Nd6 41.Rxb6 Rac7 $19 ) 40.Bd1 Ra6 {Black decides to
concentrate on protecting the b-pawn and shutting down any White activity rather
than unbalancing the game, evidently not evaluating that it would be clearly to
her benefit. Several possibilites for advantage include:} ( 40...h6 $5 {this
idea would again work to good effect here.} ) ( 40...Rh8 ) ( 40...Rc8 ) 41.Rb1 
Nd6 42.R5b2 Nc4 43.Rb4 R8a7 44.Ke2 Nd6 {the piece shuffling indicates both sides
are happy with a draw.} 45.R4b2 Nc4 46.Rb4 Nd6 47.R4b2 Nc4 1/2-1/2
