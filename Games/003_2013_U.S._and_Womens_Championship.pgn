1.c4 c6 2.Nf3 {an independent English variation. Naturally White could transpose
to a queen or king's pawn opening here.} 2...d5 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.O-O Nbd7 
6.Na3 ( 6.Qc2 {is the other main option.} 6...Nb6 7.a4 ( 7.Na3 {transposing} ) 
) 6...Nb6 7.Qc2 Be6 {this position demonstrates White's objective with
sacrificing the pawn. Black's kingside is underdeveloped and his king is in the
center, while White has a lead in development and is pressuring hard to regain
his pawn.} 8.Ne5 ( 8.Ng5 {is played the most, but only scores 45 percent for
White. The text move scores 52 percent.} ) 8...Qd4 9.Nxc6 bxc6 10.Bxc6+ Kd8 
11.Bxa8 {only a handful of games in the database now, the only game with this
move being a White loss.} ( 11.Nb5 {is Houdini's choice and was most recently
played by Timman in Wijk aan Zee:} 11...Qc5 12.Bxa8 Qxb5 13.Bg2 h5 14.h4 Bf5

(2566)-Smeets, J (2615) Wijk aan Zee NED 2013} ) 11...Nxa8 {in contrast with the
other line, now White no longer has the two bishops.} 12.d3 cxd3 13.Rd1 dxc2 
14.Rxd4+ Bd7 15.Nxc2 e5 16.Rd1 Nb6 17.Be3 Kc7 18.Ne1 {during the live
commentary, a small preference was given to Black here because two pieces
usually are more powerful than a rook. Black also has plenty of good squares for
his pieces at this point.} 18...Nfd5 19.Rac1+ Kb7 20.Bc5 {standard practice when
your opponent has the two bishops is to trade one of them off.} 20...Bxc5 
21.Rxc5 Be6 22.Nd3 e4 23.Ne5 {Houdini evalutes this position as completely
equal. Despite the R+P vs. B+N imbalance in his disfavor, White's rooks are
well-placed as is his knight, while Black's king looks a little precarious.} 
23...Ne7 24.Rd4 f6 {this may have been a psychological turning point in the
game, as White afterwards starts to gain some initiative. The eventual tactical
point of White's sequence may not have been seen.} ( 24...Bd5 $5 ) 25.Rxe4 Bd5 
26.Rg4 fxe5 27.Rxg7 {pinning the Ne7, which either results in the return of a
piece (leaving White two pawns to the good) or ties Black up in knots.} 
27...Re8 28.e4 Bg8 29.Rxe5 Nc8 30.b3 $14 {the material balance in a rough sense
somewhat favors Black, but the dominance of the White rooks and Black's passive
piece placement, along with White's mobilizing passed pawns, give White an
advantage.} 30...Kc7 31.f4 Kd6 32.Kf2 Rf8 33.Ke3 Nc6 34.Rh5 N8e7 35.h4 Ke6 
36.g4 Kf6 37.Rgg5 {the live commentary picked things up again here, noting how
the rook and pawn activity and related space advantage was in White's favor. The
position is tough to play, however, and neither player is likely to have much in
the way of similar experience to draw on.} 37...Rd8 38.Rc5 ( 38.Rh6+ Kf7 39.Rc5 
$16 {is Houdini's preference, pushing the king back before playing ...Rc5.} ) 
38...Kg7 39.Rc3 Rd1 40.Rg5+ Kf8 $11 {here Houdini gives a slight edge to Black,
who has managed to activate his pieces and get his king to a less vulnerable
square.} 41.f5 Rd6 ( 41...Ne5 $5 ) 42.Rc5 h6 ( 42...Bf7 ) 43.e5 {Houdini thinks
this is winning for Black.} ( 43.Rxg8+ Kxg8 44.a3 $15 ) 43...Rd5 44.Rxg8+ Kxg8 
45.Rxd5 Nxd5+ 46.Kf3 Nc3 47.e6 Nxa2 48.g5 hxg5 49.hxg5 Nc3 50.Ke3 Kf8 51.Kd3 
Nd5 52.Kc4 Nc7 ( 52...Ne3+ ) 53.Kc5 Nb8 {now White's king pushes forward and
Houdini evaluates the position as equal. White threatens to push the pawns
forward with the king's help, but cannot escape from the Black knights'
harrassment.} 54.Kd6 Ne8+ 55.Kd5 Nc7+ 56.Kd6 Nb5+ 57.Kc5 Nc3 58.Kd6 Nb5+ 59.Kc5 
Nc3 60.Kd6 Nb5+ 1/2-1/2
